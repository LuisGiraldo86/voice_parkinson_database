  "abstract": "Given the demand for developing the efficient Machine Learning (ML) classification models for healthcare data, and the potentiality of Bio-Inspired Optimization (BIO) algorithms to tackle the problem of high dimensional data, we investigate the range of ML classification models trained with the optimal subset of features of PD data set for efficient PD classification. We used two BIO algorithms, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), to determine the optimal subset of features of PD data set. The data set chosen for investigation comprises 756 observations (rows or records) taken over 755 attributes (columns or dimensions or features) from 252 PD patients. We employed MaxAbsolute feature scaling method to normalize the data and one hold cross-validation method to avoid biased results. Accordingly, the data is split in to training and testing set in the ratio of 70% and 30%. Subsequently, we employed GA and BPSO algorithms separately on 11 ML classifiers (Logistic Regression (LR), linear Support Vector Machine (lSVM), radial basis function Support Vector Machine (rSVM), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Ada Boost (AB) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), to determine the optimal subset of features (reduction of dimensionality) contributing to the highest classification accuracy. Among all the bio-inspired ML classifiers employed: GA-inspired MLP produced the maximum dimensionality reduction of 52.32% by selecting only 359 features and delivering 85.1% of the classification accuracy; GA-inspired AB delivered the maximum classification accuracy of 90.7% producing the dimensionality reduction of 41.43% by selecting only 441 features; And, BPSO-inspired GNB produced the maximum dimensionality reduction of 47.14% by selecting 396 features and delivering the classification accuracy of 79.3%; BPSOMLP delivered the maximum classification accuracy of 89% and produced 46.48% of the dimensionality reduction by selecting only 403 features.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that causes partial or complete loss of motor reflexes and speech and affects thinking, behavior, and other vital functions affecting the nervous system. Parkinson's disease causes impaired speech and motor abilities (writing, balance, etc.) in about 90% of patients and is often seen in older people. Some signs (deterioration of vocal cords) in medical voice recordings from Parkinson's patients are used to diagnose this disease. The database used in this study contains biomedical speech voice from 31 people of different age and sex related to this disease. The performance comparison of the machine learning algorithms k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers was performed with the used database. Moreover, the best classifier was determined for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Eleven different training and test data (45x55, 50x50, 55x45, 60x40, 65x35, 70x30, 75x25, 80x20, 85x15, 90x10, 95x5) were processed separately. The data obtained from these training and tests were compared with statistical measurements. The training results of the k-NN classification algorithm were generally 100% successful. The best test result was obtained from Random Forest classifier with 85.81%. All statistical results and measured values are given in detail in the experimental studies section.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by the disruption of the brain cells that produce substance to allow brain cells to communicate with each other, called dopamine. The cells that produce dopamine in the brain are responsible for the control, adaptation and fluency of movements. When 60-80%of these cells are lost, then enough dopamine is not produced and Parkinson's motor symptoms appear. It is thought that the disease begins many years before the motor (movement related) symptoms and therefore, researchers are looking for ways to recognize the non-motor symptoms that appear early in the disease as early as possible, thereby halting the progression of the disease. In this paper, machine learning based diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is presented. The proposed diagnosis method consists of feature selection and classification processes. Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination methods were considered for feature selection task. Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines were used for the classification of Parkinson's patients in the experiments. Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination was shown to perform better than the other methods. 93.84% accuracy was achieved with the least number of voice features for Parkinson's diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder that affects both motor and non-motor neural circuits. Speech deterioration (hypokinetic dysarthria) is a common symptom, which often presents early in the disease course. Machine learning can help movement disorders specialists improve their diagnostic accuracy using non-invasive and inexpensive voice recordings. Method: We used 'Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features Data Set' from the UCI-Machine Learning repository. The dataset included 44 speech-test based acoustic features from patients with PD and controls. We analyzed the data using various machine learning algorithms including Light and Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighborhood, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, as well as logistic regression. We also implemented a variable importance analysis to identify important variables classifying patients with PD. Results: The cohort included a total of 80 subjects: 40 patients with PD (55% men) and 40 controls (67.5% men). Disease duration was 5 years or less for all subjects, with a mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score of 19.6 (SD 8.1), and none were taking PD medication. The mean age for PD subjects and controls was 69.6 (SD 7.8) and 66.4 (SD 8.4), respectively. Our best-performing model used Light Gradient Boosting to provide an AUC of 0.951 with 95% confidence interval 0.946-0.955 in 4-fold cross validation using only seven acoustic features. Conclusions: Machine learning can accurately detect Parkinson's disease using an inexpensive and non-invasive voice recording. Light Gradient Boosting outperformed other machine learning algorithms. Such approaches could be used to inexpensively screen large patient populations for Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "Embodied cognition research on Parkinson's disease (PD) points to disruptions of frontostriatal language functions as sensitive targets for clinical assessment. However, no existing approach has been tested for crosslinguistic validity, let alone by combining naturalistic tasks with machine-learning tools. To address these issues, we conducted the first classifier-based examination of morphological processing (a core frontostriatal function) in spontaneous monologues from PD patients across three typologically different languages. The study comprised 330 participants, encompassing speakers of Spanish (61 patients, 57 matched controls), German (88 patients, 88 matched controls), and Czech (20 patients, 16 matched controls). All subjects described the activities they perform during a regular day, and their monologues were automatically coded via morphological tagging, a computerized method that labels each word with a part-of-speech tag (e.g., noun, verb) and specific morphological tags (e.g., person, gender, number, tense). The ensuing data were subjected to machine-learning analyses to assess whether differential morphological patterns could classify between patients and controls and reflect the former's degree of motor impairment. Results showed robust classification rates, with over 80% of patients being discriminated from controls in each language separately. Moreover, the most discriminative morphological features were associated with the patients' motor compromise (as indicated by Pearson r correlations between predicted and collected motor impairment scores that ranged from moderate to moderate-to-strong across languages). Taken together, our results suggest that morphological patterning, an embodied frontostriatal domain, may be distinctively affected in PD across languages and even under ecological testing conditions.",

  "abstract": "Embodied cognition research on Parkinson's disease (PD) points to disruptions of frontostriatal language functions as sensitive targets for clinical assessment. However, no existing approach has been tested for crosslinguistic validity, let alone by combining naturalistic tasks with machine-learning tools. To address these issues, we conducted the first classifier-based examination of morphological processing (a core frontostriatal function) in spontaneous monologues from PD patients across three typologically different languages. The study comprised 330 participants, encompassing speakers of Spanish (61 patients, 57 matched controls), German (88 patients, 88 matched controls), and Czech (20 patients, 16 matched controls). All subjects described the activities they perform during a regular day, and their monologues were automatically coded via morphological tagging, a computerized method that labels each word with a part-of-speech tag (e.g., noun, verb) and specific morphological tags (e.g., person, gender, number, tense). The ensuing data were subjected to machine-learning analyses to assess whether differential morphological patterns could classify between patients and controls and reflect the former's degree of motor impairment. Results showed robust classification rates, with over 80% of patients being discriminated from controls in each language separately. Moreover, the most discriminative morphological features were associated with the patients' motor compromise (as indicated by Pearson r correlations between predicted and collected motor impairment scores that ranged from moderate to moderate-to-strong across languages). Taken together, our results suggest that morphological patterning, an embodied frontostriatal domain, may be distinctively affected in PD across languages and even under ecological testing conditions.",

  "abstract": " Objectives: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder; it affects more than 10 million people worldwide. Detecting PD usually requires a professional assessment by an expert, and investigation of the voice as a biomarker of the disease could be effective in speeding up the diagnostic process. Methods: We present our methodology in which we distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (HC) using a large sample of 18,210 smartphone recordings. Those recordings were processed by an audio processing technique to create a final dataset of 80,594 instances and 138 features from the time, frequency, and cepstral domains. This dataset was preprocessed and normalized to create baseline machine-learning models using four classifiers, namely, linear support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). We divided our dataset into training and held-out test sets. Then we used stratified 5-fold cross-validation and four performance measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to assess the performance of the models. We applied two feature selection methods, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting the best subset of features that maximizes the performance of the classifiers. Results: LASSO outperformed ANOVA with almost the same number of features. With 33 features, XGBoost achieved a maximum accuracy of 95.31% on training data, and 95.78% by predicting unseen data. Conclusions: Developing a smartphone-based system that implements machine-learning techniques is an effective way to diagnose PD using the voice as a biomarker.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the mostly seen neurological disease. It affects to nervous system and hinders people's vital activities. The majority of Parkinson's patients lose their ability to speak, write and balance. Many machine learning methods have been proposed to automatically diagnose Parkinson's disease using acoustic, hand writing and gaits. In this study, a statistical pooling method is proposed to recognize Parkinson's disease using the vowels. The used Parkinson's disease dataset contains the features of vowels. In the proposed method, the features of dataset are increased by applying statistical pooling method. Then, the most weighted features are selected from increased feature vector by using ReliefF. The classification is applied using the most weighted feature vector obtained. In the proposed method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are used. The success rate was calculated as 91.25% and 91.23% with by using SVM and KNN respectively. The proposed method has two main contributions. The first is to obtain new features from the Parkinson's acoustic dataset using the statistical pooling method. The second one is the selection of the most significant features from the many feature vectors obtained. Thus, successful results were obtained for both KNN and SVM algorithms. The comparatively results clearly show that the proposed method achieved the best success rate among the selected state-of-art methods. Considering the proposed method and the results obtained, it proposed method is successful for Parkinson's disease recognition.",

  "abstract": "Voice technology has grown tremendously in recent years and using voice as a biomarker has also been gaining evidence. We demonstrate the potential of voice in serving as a deep phenotype for Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, by presenting methodology for voice signal processing for clinical analysis. Detection of PD symptoms typically requires an exam by a movement disorder specialist and can be hard to access and inconsistent in findings. A vocal digital biomarker could supplement the cumbersome existing manual exam by detecting and quantifying symptoms to guide treatment. Specifically, vocal biomarkers of PD are a potentially effective method of assessing symptoms and severity in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We analyzed a database of PD patient and non-PD subjects containing voice recordings that were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine learning models to predict PD severity. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings. We note that our methodology only advances biomarker research and is not cleared for clinical use. Specifically, we demonstrate that conventional machine learning models applied to voice signals can be used to differentiate participants with PD who exhibit little to no symptoms from healthy controls. This work highlights the potential of voice to be used for early detection of PD and indicates that voice may serve as a deep phenotype for PD, enabling precision medicine by improving the speed, accuracy, accessibility, and cost of PD management.",

  "abstract": "Embodied cognition research on Parkinson's disease (PD) points to disruptions of frontostriatal language functions as sensitive targets for clinical assessment. However, no existing approach has been tested for crosslinguistic validity, let alone by combining naturalistic tasks with machine-learning tools. To address these issues, we conducted the first classifier-based examination of morphological processing (a core frontostriatal function) in spontaneous monologues from PD patients across three typologically different languages. The study comprised 330 participants, encompassing speakers of Spanish (61 patients, 57 matched controls), German (88 patients, 88 matched controls), and Czech (20 patients, 16 matched controls). All subjects described the activities they perform during a regular day, and their monologues were automatically coded via morphological tagging, a computerized method that labels each word with a part-of-speech tag (e.g., noun, verb) and specific morphological tags (e.g., person, gender, number, tense). The ensuing data were subjected to machine-learning analyses to assess whether differential morphological patterns could classify between patients and controls and reflect the former's degree of motor impairment. Results showed robust classification rates, with over 80% of patients being discriminated from controls in each language separately. Moreover, the most discriminative morphological features were associated with the patients' motor compromise (as indicated by Pearson r correlations between predicted and collected motor impairment scores that ranged from moderate to moderate-to-strong across languages). Taken together, our results suggest that morphological patterning, an embodied frontostriatal domain, may be distinctively affected in PD across languages and even under ecological testing conditions.",

  "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by specific voice disorders collectively termed hypokinetic dysarthria. We here investigated voice changes by using machine learning algorithms, in a large cohort of patients with PD in different stages of the disease, OFF and ON therapy. Methods: We investigated 115 patients affected by PD (mean age: 68.2 ± 9.2 years) and 108 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age: 60.2 ± 11.0 years). The PD cohort included 57 early-stage patients (Hoehn &Yahr ≤ 2) who never took L-Dopa for their disease at the time of the study, and 58 mid-advanced-stage patients (Hoehn &Yahr >2) who were chronically-treated with L-Dopa. We clinically evaluated voices using specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Voice Handicap Index. Voice samples recorded through a high-definition audio recorder underwent machine learning analysis based on the support vector machine classifier. We also calculated the receiver operating characteristic curves to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the analysis and assessed possible clinical-instrumental correlations. Results: Voice is abnormal in early-stage PD and as the disease progresses, voice increasingly degradres as demonstrated by high accuracy in the discrimination between healthy subjects and PD patients in the early-stage and mid-advanced-stage. Also, L-dopa therapy improves but not restore voice in PD as shown by high accuracy in the comparison between patients OFF and ON therapy. Finally, for the first time we achieved significant clinical-instrumental correlations by using a new score (LR value) calculated by machine learning. Conclusion: Voice is abnormal in early-stage PD, progressively degrades in mid-advanced-stage and can be improved but not restored by L-Dopa. Lastly, machine learning allows tracking disease severity and quantifying the symptomatic effect of L-Dopa on voice parameters with previously unreported high accuracy, thus representing a potential new biomarker of PD.",

  "abstract": "The computerized detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) will facilitate population screening and frequent monitoring and provide a more objective measure of symptoms, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Dysarthria is an early symptom of the disease and examining it for computerized diagnosis and monitoring has been proposed. Deep learning-based approaches have advantages for such applications because they do not require manual feature extraction, and while this approach has achieved excellent results in speech recognition, its utilization in the detection of pathological voices is limited. In this work, we present an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PD from the voice recordings of 50 healthy people and 50 people with PD obtained from PC-GITA, a publicly available database. We propose a multiple-fine-tuning method to train the base CNN. This approach reduces the semantical gap between the source task that has been used for network pretraining and the target task by expanding the training process by including training on another dataset. Training and testing were performed for each vowel separately, and a 10-fold validation was performed to test the models. The performance was measured by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that this approach was able to distinguish between the voices of people with PD and those of healthy people for all vowels. While there were small differences between the different vowels, the best performance was when/a/was considered; we achieved 99% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and 89.6% AUC. This shows that the method has potential for use in clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of PD, with the advantage that vowel-based voice recordings can be performed online without requiring additional hardware.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects the movement of people, including the differences in writing skill, speech, tremor, and stiffness in muscles. It is significant to detect the PD at the initial stages so that the person can live a peaceful life for a longer time period. The serious levels of PD are highly risky as the patients get progressive stiffness, which results in the inability of standing or walking. Earlier studies have focused on the detection of PD effectively using voice and speech exams and writing exams. In this aspect, this study presents an improved sailfish optimization algorithm with deep learning (ISFO-DL) model for PD diagnosis and classification. The presented ISFO-DL technique uses the ISFO algorithm and DL model to determine PD and thereby enhances the survival rate of the person. The presented ISFO is a metaheuristic algorithm, which is inspired by a group of hunting sailfish to determine the optimum solution to the problem. Primarily, the ISFO algorithm is applied to derive an optimal subset of features with a fitness function of maximum classification accuracy. At the same time, the rat swarm optimizer (RSO) with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) is employed as a classifier to determine the existence of PD. The performance validation of the IFSO-DL model takes place using a benchmark Parkinson's dataset, and the results are inspected under several dimensions. The experimental results highlighted the enhanced classification performance of the ISFO-DL technique, and therefore, the proposed model can be employed for the earlier identification of PD. ",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with slow progression whose symptoms can be identified at late stages. Early diagnosis and treatment of PD can help to relieve the symptoms and delay progression. However, this is very challenging due to the similarities between the symptoms of PD and other diseases. The current study proposes a generic framework for the diagnosis of PD using handwritten images and (or) speech signals. For the handwriting images, 8 pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) via transfer learning tuned by Aquila Optimizer were trained on the NewHandPD dataset to diagnose PD. For the speech signals, features from the MDVR-KCL dataset are extracted numerically using 16 feature extraction algorithms and fed to 4 different machine learning algorithms tuned by Grid Search algorithm, and graphically using 5 different techniques and fed to the 8 pretrained CNN structures. The authors propose a new technique in extracting the features from the voice dataset based on the segmentation of variable speech-signal-segment-durations, i.e., the use of different durations in the segmentation phase. Using the proposed technique, 5 datasets with 281 numerical features are generated. Results from different experiments are collected and recorded. For the NewHandPD dataset, the best-reported metric is 99.75% using the VGG19 structure. For the MDVR-KCL dataset, the best-reported metrics are 99.94% using the KNN and SVM ML algorithms and the combined numerical features; and 100% using the combined the mel-specgram graphical features and VGG19 structure. These results are better than other state-of-the-art researches.",

  "abstract": "The computerized detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) will facilitate population screening and frequent monitoring and provide a more objective measure of symptoms, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Dysarthria is an early symptom of the disease and examining it for computerized diagnosis and monitoring has been proposed. Deep learning-based approaches have advantages for such applications because they do not require manual feature extraction, and while this approach has achieved excellent results in speech recognition, its utilization in the detection of pathological voices is limited. In this work, we present an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PD from the voice recordings of 50 healthy people and 50 people with PD obtained from PC-GITA, a publicly available database. We propose a multiple-fine-tuning method to train the base CNN. This approach reduces the semantical gap between the source task that has been used for network pretraining and the target task by expanding the training process by including training on another dataset. Training and testing were performed for each vowel separately, and a 10-fold validation was performed to test the models. The performance was measured by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that this approach was able to distinguish between the voices of people with PD and those of healthy people for all vowels. While there were small differences between the different vowels, the best performance was when/a/was considered; we achieved 99% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and 89.6% AUC. This shows that the method has potential for use in clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of PD, with the advantage that vowel-based voice recordings can be performed online without requiring additional hardware.",

  "abstract": "PD (Parkinson's Disease) is a severe malady that is painful and incurable, affecting older human beings. Identifying PD early in a precise manner is critical for the lengthened survival of patients, where DMTs (data mining techniques) and MLTs (machine learning techniques) can be advantageous. Studies have examined DMTs for their accuracy using Parkinson's dataset and analyzing feature relevance. Recent studies have used FMBOAs for feature selections and relevance analyses, where the selection of features aims to find the optimal subset of features for classification tasks and combine the learning of FMBOAs. EFSs (ensemble feature selections) are viable solutions for combining the benefits of multiple algorithms while balancing their drawbacks. This work uses OBEFSs (optimization-based ensemble feature selections) to select appropriate features based on agreements. Ensembles have the ability to combine results from multiple feature selection approaches, including FMBOAs, LFCSAs (Lévy flight cuckoo search algorithms), and AFAs (adaptive firefly algorithms). These approaches select optimized feature subsets, resulting in three feature subsets, which are subsequently matched for correlations by ensembles. The optimum features are generated by OBEFSs the trained on FCBi-LSTMs (fuzzy convolution bi-directional long short-term memories) for classifications. This work's suggested model uses the UCI (University of California-Irvine) learning repository, and the methods are evaluated using LOPO-CVs (Leave-One-Person-Out-Cross Validations) in terms of accuracies, F-measure values, and MCCs (Matthews correlation coefficients).",

We aim to investigate whether an analysis of acoustic and facial expressions with machine-learning algorithms assist early identification of patients with PD. We recruited 371 participants, including a training cohort (112 PD patients during 'on' phase, 111 controls) and a validation cohort (74 PD patients during 'off' phase, 74 controls). All participants underwent a smartphone-based, simultaneous recording of voice and facial expressions, while reading an article. Nine different machine learning classifiers were applied. We observed that integrated facial and voice features could discriminate early-stage PD patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) diagnostic value of 0.85. In the validation cohort, the optimal diagnostic value (0.90) maintained. We concluded that integrated biometric features of voice and facial expressions could assist the identification of early-stage PD patients from aged controls.",

  "abstract": "The computerized detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) will facilitate population screening and frequent monitoring and provide a more objective measure of symptoms, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Dysarthria is an early symptom of the disease and examining it for computerized diagnosis and monitoring has been proposed. Deep learning-based approaches have advantages for such applications because they do not require manual feature extraction, and while this approach has achieved excellent results in speech recognition, its utilization in the detection of pathological voices is limited. In this work, we present an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PD from the voice recordings of 50 healthy people and 50 people with PD obtained from PC-GITA, a publicly available database. We propose a multiple-fine-tuning method to train the base CNN. This approach reduces the semantical gap between the source task that has been used for network pretraining and the target task by expanding the training process by including training on another dataset. Training and testing were performed for each vowel separately, and a 10-fold validation was performed to test the models. The performance was measured by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that this approach was able to distinguish between the voices of people with PD and those of healthy people for all vowels. While there were small differences between the different vowels, the best performance was when/a/was considered; we achieved 99% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and 89.6% AUC. This shows that the method has potential for use in clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of PD, with the advantage that vowel-based voice recordings can be performed online without requiring additional hardware.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that negatively affects millions of people. Early detection is of vital importance. As recent researches showed dysarthria level provides good indicators to the computer-assisted diagnosis and remote monitoring of patients at the early stages. It is the goal of this study to develop an automatic detection method based on newest collected Chinese dataset. Unlike English, no agreement was reached on the main features indicating language disorders due to vocal organ dysfunction. Thus, one of our approaches is to classify the speech phonation and articulation with a machine learning-based feature selection model. Based on a relatively big sample, three feature selection algorithms (LASSO, mRMR, Relief-F) were tested to select the vocal features extracted from speech signals collected in a controlled setting, followed by four classifiers (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent) to detect the disorder. The proposed approach shows an accuracy of 75.76%, sensitivity of 82.44%, specificity of 73.15% and precision of 76.57%, indicating the feasibility and promising future for an automatic and unobtrusive detection on Chinese PD. The comparison among the three selection algorithms reveals that LASSO selector has the best performance regardless types of vocal features. The best detection accuracy is obtained by SGD classifier, while the best resulting sensitivity is obtained by LR classifier. More interestingly, articulation features are more representative and indicative than phonation features among all the selection and classifying algorithms. The most prominent articulation features are F1, F2, DDF1, DDF2, BBE and MFCC.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a slow-progressing neurological disease, affects a large percentage of the world's elderly population, and this population is expected to grow over the next decade. As a result, early detection is crucial for community health and the future of the globe in order to take proper safeguards and have a less arduous treatment procedure. Recent research has begun to focus on the motor system deficits caused by PD. Because practically most of the PD patients suffer from voice abnormalities, researchers working on automated diagnostic systems investigate vocal impairments. In this paper, we undertake extensive experiments with features extracted from voice signals. We propose a layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based diagnosis for PD. To prove the efficiency of the model, different network models are compared. To the best of our knowledge, several neural network topologies, namely RNN, Cascade Forward Neural Networks (CFNN), and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), are used and compared for voice-based PD detection for the first time. In addition, the impacts of data normalization and feature selection (FS) are thoroughly examined. The findings reveal that normalization increases classifier performance and Laplacian-based FS outperforms. The proposed RNN model with 300 voice features achieves 99.74% accuracy.",

  "abstract": "As digital health technology becomes more pervasive, machine learning (ML) provides a robust way to analyze and interpret the myriad of collected features. The purpose of this preliminary work was to use ML classification to assess the benefits and relevance of neurocognitive features both tablet-based assessments and self-reported metrics, as they relate to Parkinson's Disease (PD) and its stages [Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) Stages 1-5]. Further, this work aims to compare perceived versus sensor-based neurocognitive abilities. In this study, 75 participants ([Formula: see text] PD; [Formula: see text] control) completed 14 tablet-based neurocognitive functional tests (e.g., motor, memory, speech, executive, and multifunction), functional movement assessments (e.g., Berg Balance Scale), and standardized health questionnaires (e.g., PDQ-39). Decision tree classification of sensor-based features allowed for the discrimination of PD from healthy controls with an accuracy of [Formula: see text], and early and advanced stages of PD with an accuracy of [Formula: see text]; compared to the current gold standard tools [e.g., standardized health questionnaires ([Formula: see text] accuracy) and functional movement assessments ([Formula: see text] accuracy)]. Significant features were also identified using decision tree classification. Device magnitude of acceleration was significant in 12 of 14 tests ([Formula: see text]), regardless of test type. For classification between diagnosed and control populations, 17 motor (e.g., device magnitude of acceleration), 9 accuracy (e.g., number of correct/incorrect interactions), and 8 timing features (e.g., time to between interactions) were significant. For classification between early (H&Y Stages 1 and 2) and advanced (H&Y Stages 3, 4, and 5) stages of PD, 7 motor, 12 accuracy, and 14 timing features were significant. Finally, this work depicts that perceived functionality of individuals with PD differed from sensor-based functionalities. In early-stage PD was shown to be [Formula: see text] lower than sensor-based scores with notable perceived deficits in memory and executive function. However, individuals in advanced stages had elevated perceptions (1.57x) for executive and behavioral functions compared to early-stage populations. Machine learning in digital health systems allows for a more comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and their stages and may also depict new features that influence the ways digital health technology should be configured.",

The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results.

Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results.

  "abstract": "Machine learning approaches have been used for the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease with voice recordings being the most used data type due to the simple and non-invasive nature of acquiring such data. Although voice recordings captured via telephone or mobile devices allow much easier and wider access for data collection, current conflicting performance results limit their clinical applicability. This study has two novel contributions. First, we show the reliability of personal telephone-collected voice recordings of the sustained vowel /a/ in natural settings by collecting samples from 50 people with specialist-diagnosed Parkinson's disease and 50 healthy controls and applying machine learning classification with voice features related to phonation. Second, we utilize a novel application of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (Inception V3) with transfer learning to analyze the spectrograms of the sustained vowel from these samples. This approach considers speech intensity estimates across time and frequency scales rather than collapsing measurements across time. We show the superiority of our deep learning model for the task of classifying people with Parkinson's disease as distinct from healthy controls.",

  "abstract": "Currently, machine learning methods have been utilized to realize the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) by using voice signals. Because the vocal system of each person is unique, and the same person's pronunciation can be different at different times, the training samples used in machine learning become very different from the speech signal of the patient to be diagnosed, frequently resulting in poor diagnostic performance. On this account, this paper presents a new intelligent personalized diagnosis method (PDM) for Parkinson's disease. The method was designed to begin with constructing new training data by assigning the best classifier to each training sample composed of features from the speech signals of patients. Subsequently, a meta-classifier was trained on the new training data. Finally, for the signal of each test patient, the method used the meta-classifier to select the most appropriate classifier, followed by adopting the selected classifier to classify the signal so that the more accurate diagnosis result of the test patient can be obtained. The novelty of the proposed method is that the proposed method uses different classifiers to perform the diagnosis of PD for diversified patients, whereas the current method uses the same classifier to diagnose all patients to be tested. Results of a large number of experiments show that PDM not only improves the performance but also exceeds the existing methods in speed.",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.",

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease is the second-most-common neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor skills, cognitive processes, mood, and everyday tasks such as speaking and walking. The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results. However, these algorithms were developed on single, limited datasets, with participants possessing similar demographics. Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling.

Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory.

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease is the second-most-common neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor skills, cognitive processes, mood, and everyday tasks such as speaking and walking. The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results. However, these algorithms were developed on single, limited datasets, with participants possessing similar demographics. Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease is the second-most-common neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor skills, cognitive processes, mood, and everyday tasks such as speaking and walking. The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results. However, these algorithms were developed on single, limited datasets, with participants possessing similar demographics. Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to corrosion of the substantianigra, located in the thalamic region of the human brain, and is responsible for the transmission of neural signals throughout the human body using brain chemical, termed as “dopamine.” Diagnosis of PD is difficult, as it is often affected by the characteristics of the medical data of the patients, which include the presence of various indicators, imbalance cases of patients' data records, similar cases of healthy/affected persons, etc. Hence, sometimes the process of diagnosis may also be affected by human error. To overcome this problem some intelligent models have been proposed; however, most of them are single classifier-based models and due to this these models cannot handle noisy and imbalanced data properly and thus sometimes overfit the model. To reduce bias and variance, and to avoid overfitting of a single classifier-based model, this paper proposes an ensemble-based PD diagnosis model, named Ensembled Expert System for Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (EESDPD) with relevant features and a simple stacking ensemble technique. The proposed EESDPD aggregates diverse assumptions for making the prediction. The performance of the proposed EESDPD is compared with the performances of logistic regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, simple Decision Tree, B-TDS-PD and B-TESM-PD in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score measures.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the significant common neurological disorders of the current age that causes uncontrollable movements like shaking, stiffness, and difficulty. The early clinical diagnosis of this disease is essential for preventing the progression of PD. Hence, an innovative method is proposed here based on combining the crow search algorithm and decision tree (CSADT) for the early PD diagnosis. This approach is used on four crucial Parkinson's datasets, including meander, spiral, voice, and speech-Sakar. Using the presented method, PD is effectively diagnosed by evaluating each dataset's critical features and extracting the primary practical outcomes. The used algorithm was compared with other machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), naive Baye (NB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), random tree, logistic regression, support vector machine of radial base functions (SVM of RBFs), and combined classifier in terms of accuracy, recall, and combination measure F1. The analytical results emphasize the used algorithm's superiority over the other selected ones. The proposed model yields nearly 100% accuracy through various trials on the datasets. Notably, a high detection speed achieved the lowest detection time of 2.6 seconds. The main novelty of this paper is attributed to the accuracy of the presented PD diagnosis method, which is much higher than its counterparts.",

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease is the second-most-common neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor skills, cognitive processes, mood, and everyday tasks such as speaking and walking. The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results. However, these algorithms were developed on single, limited datasets, with participants possessing similar demographics. Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. Methods: We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Results: An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. Conclusions: More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

  "abstract": "Introduction: The analysis of vocal samples from patients with Parkinson's disease (PDP) can be relevant in supporting early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Intriguingly, speech analysis embeds several complexities influenced by speaker characteristics (e.g., gender and language) and recording conditions (e.g., professional microphones or smartphones, supervised, or non-supervised data collection). Moreover, the set of vocal tasks performed, such as sustained phonation, reading text, or monologue, strongly affects the speech dimension investigated, the feature extracted, and, as a consequence, the performance of the overall algorithm. Methods: We employed six datasets, including a cohort of 176 Healthy Control (HC) participants and 178 PDP from different nationalities (i.e., Italian, Spanish, Czech), recorded in variable scenarios through various devices (i.e., professional microphones and smartphones), and performing several speech exercises (i.e., vowel phonation, sentence repetition). Aiming to identify the effectiveness of different vocal tasks and the trustworthiness of features independent of external co-factors such as language, gender, and data collection modality, we performed several intra- and inter-corpora statistical analyses. In addition, we compared the performance of different feature selection and classification models to evaluate the most robust and performing pipeline. Results: According to our results, the combined use of sustained phonation and sentence repetition should be preferred over a single exercise. As for the set of features, the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients demonstrated to be among the most effective parameters in discriminating between HC and PDP, also in the presence of heterogeneous languages and acquisition techniques. Conclusion: Even though preliminary, the results of this work can be exploited to define a speech protocol that can effectively capture vocal alterations while minimizing the effort required to the patient. Moreover, the statistical analysis identified a set of features minimally dependent on gender, language, and recording modalities. This discloses the feasibility of extensive cross-corpora tests to develop robust and reliable tools for disease monitoring and staging and PDP follow-up",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the significant common neurological disorders of the current age that causes uncontrollable movements like shaking, stiffness, and difficulty. The early clinical diagnosis of this disease is essential for preventing the progression of PD. Hence, an innovative method is proposed here based on combining the crow search algorithm and decision tree (CSADT) for the early PD diagnosis. This approach is used on four crucial Parkinson's datasets, including meander, spiral, voice, and speech-Sakar. Using the presented method, PD is effectively diagnosed by evaluating each dataset's critical features and extracting the primary practical outcomes. The used algorithm was compared with other machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), naive Baye (NB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), random tree, logistic regression, support vector machine of radial base functions (SVM of RBFs), and combined classifier in terms of accuracy, recall, and combination measure F1. The analytical results emphasize the used algorithm's superiority over the other selected ones. The proposed model yields nearly 100% accuracy through various trials on the datasets. Notably, a high detection speed achieved the lowest detection time of 2.6 seconds. The main novelty of this paper is attributed to the accuracy of the presented PD diagnosis method, which is much higher than its counterparts.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurological disorder that leads to a range of motor and cognitive symptoms. A PD diagnosis is difficult since its symptoms are quite similar to those of other disorders, such as normal aging and essential tremor. When people reach 50, visible symptoms such as difficulties walking and communicating begin to emerge. Even though there is no cure for PD, certain medications can relieve some of the symptoms. Patients can maintain their lifestyles by controlling the complications caused by the disease. At this point, it is essential to detect this disease and prevent it from progressing. The diagnosis of the disease has been the subject of much research. In our project, we aim to detect PD using different types of Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to differentiate between healthy and PD patients by voice signal features. The dataset taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository consisted of 195 voice recordings of examinations carried out on 31 patients. Moreover, our models were trained using different techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Feature Selection, and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to enhance their performance. At the end, we found that MLP and SVM with a ratio of 70:30 train/test split using GridSearchCV with SMOTE gave the best results for our project. MLP performed with an overall accuracy of 98.31%, an overall recall of 98%, an overall precision of 100%, and f1-score of 99%. In addition, SVM performed with an overall accuracy of 95%, an overall recall of 96%, an overall precision of 98%, and f1-score of 97%. The experimental results of this research imply that the proposed method can be used to reliably predict PD and can be easily incorporated into healthcare for diagnosis purposes.",

  "abstract": "Currently, machine learning methods have been utilized to realize the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) by using voice signals. Because the vocal system of each person is unique, and the same person's pronunciation can be different at different times, the training samples used in machine learning become very different from the speech signal of the patient to be diagnosed, frequently resulting in poor diagnostic performance. On this account, this paper presents a new intelligent personalized diagnosis method (PDM) for Parkinson's disease. The method was designed to begin with constructing new training data by assigning the best classifier to each training sample composed of features from the speech signals of patients. Subsequently, a meta-classifier was trained on the new training data. Finally, for the signal of each test patient, the method used the meta-classifier to select the most appropriate classifier, followed by adopting the selected classifier to classify the signal so that the more accurate diagnosis result of the test patient can be obtained. The novelty of the proposed method is that the proposed method uses different classifiers to perform the diagnosis of PD for diversified patients, whereas the current method uses the same classifier to diagnose all patients to be tested. Results of a large number of experiments show that PDM not only improves the performance but also exceeds the existing methods in speed.",

  "abstract": "Speech-based approaches for assessing Parkinson's Disease (PD) often rely on feature extraction for automatic classification or detection. While many studies prioritize accuracy by using non-interpretable embeddings from Deep Neural Networks, this work aims to explore the predictive capabilities and language robustness of both feature types in a systematic fashion. As interpretable features, prosodic, linguistic, and cognitive descriptors were adopted, while x-vectors, Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and TRILLsson representations were used as non-interpretable features. Mono-lingual, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual machine learning experiments were conducted leveraging six data sets comprising speech recordings from various languages: American English, Castilian Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Italian, German, and Czech. For interpretable feature-based models, the mean of the best F1-scores obtained from each language was 81% in mono-lingual, 81% in multi-lingual, and 71% in cross-lingual experiments. For non-interpretable feature-based models, instead, they were 85% in mono-lingual, 88% in multi-lingual, and 79% in cross-lingual experiments. Firstly, models based on non-interpretable features outperformed interpretable ones, especially in cross-lingual experiments. Specifically, TRILLsson provided the most stable and accurate results across tasks and data sets. Conversely, the two types of features adopted showed some level of language robustness in multi-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. Overall, these results suggest that interpretable feature-based models can be used by clinicians to evaluate the deterioration of the speech of patients with PD, while non-interpretable feature-based models can be leveraged to achieve higher detection accuracy.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson's voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16 kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigación en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97 ± 0.03, recall: 0.96 ± 0.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.",

  "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder and a growing health concern in demographically aging societies. The prevalence of PD among individuals over the age of 60 and 80 years has been reported to range between 1% and 4%. A timely diagnosis of PD is desirable, even though it poses challenges to medical systems. Objective: This study aimed to classify PD and healthy controls based on the analysis of voice records at different frequencies using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: The voices of 252 individuals aged 33 to 87 years were recorded. Based on the voice record data, ML algorithms can distinguish PD patients and healthy controls. One binary decision variable was associated with 756 instances and 754 attributes. Voice records data were analyzed through supervised ML algorithms and pipelines. A 10-fold cross-validation method was used to validate models. Results: In the classification of PD patients, ML models were performed with 84.21 accuracy, 93 precision, 89 Sensitivity, 89 F1-scores, and 87 AUC. The pipeline performance improved to accuracy: 85.09, precision: 92, Sensitivity:91, F1-score: 89, and AUC: 90. The Pipeline methods improved the performance of classifying PD from voice record. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that ML classifiers and pipelines can classify PD patients based on speech biomarkers. It was found that pipelines were more effective at selecting the most relevant features from high-dimensional data and at accurately classifying PD patients and healthy controls. This approach can therefore be used for early diagnosis of initial forms of PD.",

  "abstract": "Speech change is a biometric marker for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, evaluating speech variability across diverse languages is challenging. We aimed to develop a cross-language algorithm differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls using a Taiwanese and Korean speech data set. We recruited 299 healthy controls and 347 patients with PD from Taiwan and Korea. Participants with PD underwent smartphone-based speech recordings during the 'on' phase. Each Korean participant performed various speech texts, while the Taiwanese participant read a standardized, fixed-length article. Korean short-speech (≦15 syllables) and long-speech (> 15 syllables) recordings were combined with the Taiwanese speech dataset. The merged dataset was split into a training set (controls vs. early-stage PD) and a validation set (controls vs. advanced-stage PD) to evaluate the model's effectiveness in differentiating PD patients from controls across languages based on speech length. Numerous acoustic and linguistic speech features were extracted and combined with machine learning algorithms to distinguish PD patients from controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to assess diagnostic performance. Random forest and AdaBoost classifiers showed an AUROC 0.82 for distinguishing patients with early-stage PD from controls. In the validation cohort, the random forest algorithm maintained this value (0.90) for discriminating advanced-stage PD patients. The model showed superior performance in the combined language cohort (AUROC 0.90) than either the Korean (AUROC 0.87) or Taiwanese (AUROC 0.88) cohorts individually. However, with another merged speech data set of short-speech recordings < 25 characters, the diagnostic performance to identify early-stage PD patients from controls dropped to 0.72 and showed a further limited ability to discriminate advanced-stage patients. Leveraging multifaceted speech features, including both acoustic and linguistic characteristics, could aid in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals, even across different languages. ",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurological condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairments, typically manifesting around the age of 50 and presenting symptoms such as gait difficulties and speech impairments. Although a cure remains elusive, symptom management through medication is possible. Timely detection is pivotal for effective disease management. In this study, we leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) models, to differentiate between individuals with PD and healthy individuals based on voice signal characteristics. Our dataset, sourced from the University of California at Irvine (UCI), comprises 195 voice recordings collected from 31 patients. To optimize model performance, we employ various strategies including Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for addressing class imbalance, Feature Selection to identify the most relevant features, and hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. Our experimentation reveals that the FNN and KSVM models, trained on an 80-20 split of the dataset for training and testing respectively, yield the most promising results. The FNN model achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 99.11%, with 98.78% recall, 99.96% precision, and a 99.23% f1-score. Similarly, the KSVM model demonstrates strong performance with an overall accuracy of 95.89%, recall of 96.88%, precision of 98.71%, and an f1-score of 97.62%. Overall, our study showcases the efficacy of ML and DL techniques in accurately identifying PD from voice signals, underscoring the potential for these approaches to contribute significantly to early diagnosis and intervention strategies for Parkinson's Disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurological condition after Alzheimer's. The significant number of individuals afflicted with this illness makes it essential to develop a method to diagnose the conditions in their early phases. PD is typically identified from motor symptoms or via other Neuroimaging techniques. Expensive, time-consuming, and unavailable to the general public, these methods are not very accurate. Another issue to be addressed is the black-box nature of machine learning methods that needs interpretation. These issues encourage us to develop a novel technique using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Hard Voting Ensemble Method based on voice signals to diagnose PD more accurately. Another purpose of this study is to interpret the output of the model and determine the most important features in diagnosing PD. The present article uses Pearson Correlation Coefficients to understand the relationship between input features and the output. Input features with high correlation are selected and then classified by the Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging. Moreover, the weights in Hard Voting Ensemble Method are determined based on the performance of the mentioned classifiers. At the final stage, it uses SHAP to determine the most important features in PD diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using 'Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features' from the UCI machine learning repository. It has achieved an accuracy of 85.42%. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches and can assist physicians in diagnosing Parkinson's cases.",

  "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is sthe second most common neurodegenerative disease and affects millions of people. Accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment in the early stages can slow down disease progression. However, making an accurate diagnosis of PD at an early stage is challenging. Previous studies have revealed that even for movement disorder specialists, it was difficult to differentiate patients with PD from healthy individuals until the average modified Hoehn-Yahr staging (mH&Y) reached 1.8. Recent researches have shown that dysarthria provides good indicators for computer-assisted diagnosis of patients with PD. However, few studies have focused on diagnosing patients with PD in the early stages, specifically those with mH&Y ≤ 1.5. Method: We used a machine learning algorithm to analyze voice features and developed diagnostic models for differentiating between healthy controls (HCs) and patients with PD, and for differentiating between HCs and patients with mild PD (mH&Y ≤ 1.5). The models were independently validated using separate datasets. Results: Our results demonstrate that, a remarkable diagnostic performance of the model in identifying patients with mild PD (mH&Y ≤ 1.5) and HCs, with area under the ROC curve 0.93 (95% CI: 0.851.00), accuracy 0.85, sensitivity 0.95, and specificity 0.75. Conclusion: The results of our study are helpful for screening PD in the early stages in the community and primary medical institutions where there is a lack of movement disorder specialists and special equipment.",

  "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques are becoming more popular for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) because they offer non-invasive and easily accessible tools. By using advanced data analysis, these methods improve early detection and diagnosis, which is crucial for managing the disease effectively. This study explores end-to-end DL architectures, such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, for diagnosing PD using self-reported voice data collected via smartphones in everyday settings. Transfer learning was applied by starting with models pre-trained on large datasets from the image and the audio domains and then fine-tuning them on the mPower voice data. The Transformer model pre-trained on the voice data performed the best, achieving an average AUC of [Formula: see text] and an average AUPRC of [Formula: see text], outperforming models trained from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a Transformer model for audio data in PD diagnosis, using this dataset. We achieved better results than previous studies, whether they focused solely on the voice or incorporated multiple modalities, by relying only on the voice as a biomarker. These results show that using self-reported voice data with state-of-the-art DL architectures can significantly improve PD prediction and diagnosis, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning-based Parkinson's disease (PD) speech diagnosis is a current research hotspot. However, existing methods use each corpus sample as the base unit for modeling. Since different corpus samples within the same subject have different sensitive speech features, it is difficult to obtain unified and stable sensitive speech features (diagnostic markers) that reflect the pathology of the whole subject. Therefore, this study aims at compressing the corpus samples within the subject to facilitate the search for diagnostic markers with high diagnostic accuracy. A two-step sample compression module (TSCM) can solve the problem above. It includes two major parts: sample pruning module (SPM) and sample fuzzy clustering mechanism (SFCMD). Based on stacking multiple TSCMs, a multilayer sample compression module (MSCM) is formed to obtain multilayer compression samples. After that, simultaneous sample/feature selection mechanism (SS/FSM) is designed for feature selection. Based on the multilayer compression samples processed by MSCM and SS/FSM, a novel ensemble learning algorithm (EMSFE) is designed with sparse fusion ensemble learning mechanism (SFELM). The proposed EMSFE is validated by visualization of extracted features and performance comparison with related algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the stable diagnostic markers by compressing the corpus samples within the subject. Furthermore, based on LOSO cross validation, the proposed algorithm with extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier can achieve the accuracy of 92.5%, 93.75% and 91.67% on three datasets, respectively. The proposed EMSFE can extract unified and stable sensitive features that accurately reflect the overall pathology of the subject, which can better meet the requirements of clinical applications.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson's voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16 kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigación en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97 ± 0.03, recall: 0.96 ± 0.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.",

  "abstract": "Diagnostic tests for Parkinsonism based on speech samples have shown promising results. Although abnormal auditory feedback integration during speech production and impaired rhythmic organization of speech are known in Parkinsonism, these aspects have not been incorporated into diagnostic tests. This study aimed to identify Parkinsonism using a novel speech behavioral test that involved rhythmically repeating syllables under different auditory feedback conditions. The study included 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 30 healthy subjects. Participants were asked to rhythmically repeat the PA-TA-KA syllable sequence, both whispering and speaking aloud under various listening conditions. The results showed that individuals with PD had difficulties in whispering and articulating under altered auditory feedback conditions, exhibited delayed speech onset, and demonstrated inconsistent rhythmic structure across trials compared to controls. These parameters were then fed into a supervised machine-learning algorithm to differentiate between the two groups. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 85.4%, a sensitivity of 86.5%, and a specificity of 84.3%. This pilot study highlights the potential of the proposed behavioral paradigm as an objective and accessible (both in cost and time) test for identifying individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects approximately 6 million people worldwide. Data analysis of early PD symptoms using machine learning (ML) models may provide an inexpensive, non-invasive, and simple method for the remote diagnosis of early PD. The aim of this project was to analyze voice, computer keystrokes, spiral drawings, and gait data involving PD patients and controls available in public databases using ML models and identify early PD characteristics that are more pronounced than others. An ML model was developed using Random Forest to analyze existing clinical data for PD patients, prodromal PD patients with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) symptoms, and non-PD healthy controls. We reviewed and collected data from the UCI (University of California Irvine) Machine Learning Repository, PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative), and Kaggle databases. ML analysis was carried out on voice samples in PD and RBD patients, computer keystroke data, spiral drawings, and gait datasets. The ML prediction model developed may be helpful in improving risk prediction for PD, enabling early intervention and resource prioritization. The ML study suggests that voice analysis is the most robust test, followed by computer keystroke data, spiral drawings, and gait analysis, in that order. Voice is affected even in RBD patients, revealing that it is a sensitive and early measure of prodromal PD. The low accuracy of the analysis indicates that several PD-positive samples may remain undetected and unclassified. Combining all four features, that is, voice analysis, computer keystroke data, spiral drawings, and gait analysis, may improve the overall accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Background: Timely detection of neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions is crucial for early intervention. Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in children and Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in speech disturbances that may be exploited for diagnostic screening using recorded speech signals. We were motivated to develop an accurate yet computationally lightweight model for speech-based detection of SLI and PD, employing novel feature engineering techniques to mimic the adaptable dynamic weight assignment network capability of deep learning architectures. Materials and methods: In this research, we have introduced an advanced feature engineering model incorporating a novel feature extraction function, the Factor Lattice Pattern (FLP), which is a quantum-inspired method and uses a superposition-like mechanism, making it dynamic in nature. The FLP encompasses eight distinct patterns, from which the most appropriate pattern was discerned based on the data structure. Through the implementation of the FLP, we automatically extracted signal-specific textural features. Additionally, we developed a new feature engineering model to assess the efficacy of the FLP. This model is self-organizing, producing nine potential results and subsequently choosing the optimal one. Our speech classification framework consists of (1) feature extraction using the proposed FLP and a statistical feature extractor; (2) feature selection employing iterative neighborhood component analysis and an intersection-based feature selector; (3) classification via support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors; and (4) outcome determination using combinational majority voting to select the most favorable results. Results: To validate the classification capabilities of our proposed feature engineering model, designed to automatically detect PD and SLI, we employed three speech datasets of PD and SLI patients. Our presented FLP-centric model achieved classification accuracy of more than 95% and 99.79% for all PD and SLI datasets, respectively. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the proposed model is an accurate alternative to deep learning models in classifying neurological conditions using speech signals.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor deficits, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. According to the World Health Organization, about 1 % of the global population has been diagnosed with PD, and this figure is expected to double by 2040. Early and accurate diagnosis of PD is critical to slowing down the progression of the disease and reducing long-term disability. Due to the complexity of the disease, it is difficult to accurately diagnose it using traditional clinical tests. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop intelligent diagnostic models that can accurately detect PD. This article introduces a novel hybrid approach for accurate prediction of PD using an ANFIS with two optimizers, namely Adam and PSO. ANFIS is a type of fuzzy logic system used for nonlinear function approximation and classification, while Adam optimizer has the ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate of each individual parameter in an ANFIS at each training step, which helps the model find a better solution more quickly. PSO is a metaheuristic approach inspired by the behavior of social animals such as birds. Combining these two methods has potential to provide improved accuracy and robustness in PD diagnosis compared to existing methods. The proposed method utilized the advantages of both optimization techniques and applied them on the developed ANFIS model to maximize its prediction accuracy. This system was developed by using an open access clinical and demographic data. The chosen parameters for the ANFIS were selected through a comparative experimental analysis to optimize the model considering the number of fuzzy membership functions, number of epochs of ANFIS, and number of particles of PSO. The performance of the two ANFIS models: ANFIS (Adam) and ANFIS (PSO) focusing at ANFIS parameters and various evaluation metrics are further analyzed in detail and presented, The experimental results showed that the proposed ANFIS (PSO) shows better results in terms of loss and precision, whereas, the ANFIS (Adam) showed the better results in terms of accuracy, f1-score and recall. Thus, this adaptive neural-fuzzy algorithm provides a promising strategy for the diagnosis of PD, and show that the proposed models show their suitability for many other practical applications.",

  "abstract": "Background: Timely detection of neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions is crucial for early intervention. Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in children and Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in speech disturbances that may be exploited for diagnostic screening using recorded speech signals. We were motivated to develop an accurate yet computationally lightweight model for speech-based detection of SLI and PD, employing novel feature engineering techniques to mimic the adaptable dynamic weight assignment network capability of deep learning architectures. Materials and methods: In this research, we have introduced an advanced feature engineering model incorporating a novel feature extraction function, the Factor Lattice Pattern (FLP), which is a quantum-inspired method and uses a superposition-like mechanism, making it dynamic in nature. The FLP encompasses eight distinct patterns, from which the most appropriate pattern was discerned based on the data structure. Through the implementation of the FLP, we automatically extracted signal-specific textural features. Additionally, we developed a new feature engineering model to assess the efficacy of the FLP. This model is self-organizing, producing nine potential results and subsequently choosing the optimal one. Our speech classification framework consists of (1) feature extraction using the proposed FLP and a statistical feature extractor; (2) feature selection employing iterative neighborhood component analysis and an intersection-based feature selector; (3) classification via support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors; and (4) outcome determination using combinational majority voting to select the most favorable results. Results: To validate the classification capabilities of our proposed feature engineering model, designed to automatically detect PD and SLI, we employed three speech datasets of PD and SLI patients. Our presented FLP-centric model achieved classification accuracy of more than 95% and 99.79% for all PD and SLI datasets, respectively. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the proposed model is an accurate alternative to deep learning models in classifying neurological conditions using speech signals.",

  "abstract": "This study advances the automation of Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis by analyzing speech characteristics, leveraging a comprehensive approach that integrates a voting-based machine learning model. Given the growing prevalence of PD, especially among the elderly population, continuous and efficient diagnosis is of paramount importance. Conventional monitoring methods suffer from limitations related to time, cost, and accessibility, underscoring the need for the development of automated diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a robust model for classifying speech patterns in Korean PD patients, addressing a significant research gap. Our model employs straightforward preprocessing techniques and a voting-based machine learning approach, demonstrating superior performance, particularly when training data is limited. Furthermore, we emphasize the effectiveness of the eGeMAPSv2 feature set in PD analysis and introduce new features that substantially enhance classification accuracy. The proposed model, achieving an accuracy of 84.73 % and an area under the ROC (AUC) score of 92.18 % on a dataset comprising 100 Korean PD patients and 100 healthy controls, offers a practical solution for automated diagnosis applications, such as smartphone apps. Future research endeavors will concentrate on enhancing the model's performance and delving deeper into the relationship between high-importance features and PD.",

  "abstract": "Objective: This study evaluates the efficacy of voice analysis combined with machine learning (ML) techniques in enabling the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Voice data, phonation of the vowel 'a,' from three distinct datasets (two from the University of California Irvine ML Repository and one from figshare) for 432 participants (278 PD patients) were analyzed. We employed four ML models-Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-alongside two ensemble methods (soft voting classifier-Ensemble Voting Classifier and stacking method-Ensemble Stacking Model (ESM)). The models underwent 50 iterations of evaluation, involving various data splits and 10-fold cross-validation. Comparative analysis was done using one-way Analysis of Variance followed by Bonferroni posthoc corrections. Results: The ESM, SVM, and GB models emerged as the top performers, demonstrating superior performance across metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Despite data heterogeneity and variable selection limitations, the models showed high values for all metrics. Conclusions: ML integration with voice analysis, mainly through ESM, SVM, and GB, is promising for early PD diagnosis. Using multi-source data and a large sample size enhances our findings' validity, reliability, and generalizability. Significance: Integrating advanced ML techniques with voice analysis demonstrates substantial potential for improving early PD detection, offering valuable tools for speech-language pathologists (SLPs). These findings provide clinically relevant insights that can be applied within the scope of SLP practice to refine diagnostic processes and facilitate early intervention.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning-based Parkinson's disease (PD) speech diagnosis is a current research hotspot. However, existing methods use each corpus sample as the base unit for modeling. Since different corpus samples within the same subject have different sensitive speech features, it is difficult to obtain unified and stable sensitive speech features (diagnostic markers) that reflect the pathology of the whole subject. Therefore, this study aims at compressing the corpus samples within the subject to facilitate the search for diagnostic markers with high diagnostic accuracy. A two-step sample compression module (TSCM) can solve the problem above. It includes two major parts: sample pruning module (SPM) and sample fuzzy clustering mechanism (SFCMD). Based on stacking multiple TSCMs, a multilayer sample compression module (MSCM) is formed to obtain multilayer compression samples. After that, simultaneous sample/feature selection mechanism (SS/FSM) is designed for feature selection. Based on the multilayer compression samples processed by MSCM and SS/FSM, a novel ensemble learning algorithm (EMSFE) is designed with sparse fusion ensemble learning mechanism (SFELM). The proposed EMSFE is validated by visualization of extracted features and performance comparison with related algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the stable diagnostic markers by compressing the corpus samples within the subject. Furthermore, based on LOSO cross validation, the proposed algorithm with extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier can achieve the accuracy of 92.5%, 93.75% and 91.67% on three datasets, respectively. The proposed EMSFE can extract unified and stable sensitive features that accurately reflect the overall pathology of the subject, which can better meet the requirements of clinical applications.",

  "abstract": "Background: Traditional classifier for the classification of diseases, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), often struggle with high-dimensional medical datasets. Objective: This study presents a novel classifier to overcome the limitations of traditional classifiers in Parkinson's disease (PD) detection based on Gower distance. Methods: We present the Gower distance metric to handle diverse feature sets in voice recordings, which acts as a dissimilarity measure for all feature types, making the model adept at identifying subtle patterns indicative of PD. Additionally, the Cuckoo Search algorithm is employed for feature selection, reducing dimensionality by focusing on key features, thereby lessening the computational load associated with high-dimensional datasets. Results: The proposed classifier based on Gower distance resulted in an accuracy rate of 98.3% with feature selection and achieved an accuracy of 94.92% without the feature selection method. It outperforms traditional classifiers and recent studies in PD detection from voice recordings. Conclusions: This accuracy shows the capability of the approach in the correct classification of instances and points out the potential of the approach as a reliable diagnostic tool for the medical practitioner. The findings state that the proposed approach holds promise for improving the diagnosis and monitoring of PD, both within medical institutions and at homes for the elderly.",

  "abstract": "The work elucidates the importance of accurate Parkinson's disease classification within medical diagnostics and introduces a novel framework for achieving this goal. Specifically, the study focuses on enhancing disease identification accuracy utilizing boosting methods. A standout contribution of this work lies in the utilization of a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) coupled with hyperparameter tuning through grid search optimization (GSO) on the Parkinson's disease dataset derived from speech recording signals. In addition, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) has also been employed as a pre-processing technique to balance the dataset, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the analysis. This approach is a novel addition to the study and underscores its potential to enhance disease identification accuracy. The datasets employed in this work include both gender-specific and combined cases, utilizing several distinctive feature subsets including baseline, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), time-frequency, wavelet transform (WT), vocal fold, and tunable-Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art boosting methods, such as AdaBoost and XG-Boost, reveal the superior performance of our proposed approach across diverse datasets and metrics. Notably, on the male cohort dataset, our method achieves exceptional results, demonstrating an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 1.00, sensitivity of 0.97, F1-Score of 0.98, and specificity of 1.00 when utilizing all features with GSO-LGBM. In comparison to AdaBoost and XGBoost, the proposed framework utilizing LGBM demonstrates superior accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 5% in classification accuracy across all feature subsets and datasets. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed methodology to enhance disease identification accuracy and provide valuable insights for further advancements in medical diagnostics.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a globally significant health challenge, necessitating accurate and timely diagnostic methods to facilitate effective treatment and intervention. In recent years, self-supervised deep representation pattern learning (SS-DRPL) has emerged as a promising approach for extracting valuable representations from data, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency of voice-based PD detection. This research study focuses on investigating the utilization of SS-DRPL in conjunction with deep learning algorithms for voice-based PD classification. This study encompasses a comprehensive evaluation aimed at assessing the accuracy of various predictive models, particularly deep learning methods when combined with SS-DRPL. Two deep learning architectures, namely hybrid Long Short-Term Memory and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), are employed and compared in terms of their ability to detect voice-based PD cases accurately. Additionally, several traditional machine learning models are also included to establish a baseline for comparison. The findings of the study reveal that the incorporation of SS-DRPL leads to improved model performance across all experimental setups. Notably, the LSTM-RNN architecture augmented with SS-DRPL achieves the highest F1-score of 0.94, indicating its superior ability to detect PD cases using voice-based data effectively. This outcome underscores the efficacy of SS-DRPL in enabling deep learning models to learn intricate patterns and correlations within the data, thereby facilitating more accurate PD classification.",

  "abstract": "Background and objective: Automatic voice condition analysis systems to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally based on speech data recorded under acoustically controlled conditions and professional supervision. The performance of these approaches in a free-living scenario is unknown. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of uncontrolled conditions (realistic acoustic environment and lack of supervision) on the performance of automatic PD detection systems based on speech. Methods: A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system is proposed to aid in the detection of PD using speech. The system is based on a server-client architecture. In the server, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms are designed and implemented to discriminate subjects with PD from healthy ones. The Android app allows patients to submit phonations and physicians to check the complete record of every patient. Six different machine learning classifiers are applied to compare their performance on two different speech databases. One of them is an in-house database (UEX database), collected under professional supervision by using the same Android-based smartphone in the same room, whereas the other one is an age, sex and health-status balanced subset of mPower study for PD, which provides real-world data. By applying identical methodology, single-database experiments have been performed on each database, and also cross-database tests. Cross-validation has been applied to assess generalization performance and hypothesis tests have been used to report statistically significant differences. Results: In the single-database experiments, a best accuracy rate of 0.92 (AUC = 0.98) has been obtained on UEX database, while a considerably lower best accuracy rate of 0.71 (AUC = 0.76) has been achieved using the mPower-based database. The cross-database tests provided very degraded accuracy metrics.  Conclusion: The results clearly show the potential of the proposed system as an aid for general practitioners to conduct triage or an additional tool for neurologists to perform diagnosis. However, due to the performance degradation observed using data from mPower study, semi-controlled conditions are encouraged, i.e., voices recorded at home by the patients themselves following a strict recording protocol and control of the information about patients by the medical doctor at charge.

  "abstract": "Background: Access to neurological care for Parkinson disease (PD) is a rare privilege for millions of people worldwide, especially in resource-limited countries. In 2013, there were just 1200 neurologists in India for a population of 1.3 billion people; in Africa, the average population per neurologist exceeds 3.3 million people. In contrast, 60,000 people receive a diagnosis of PD every year in the United States alone, and similar patterns of rising PD cases-fueled mostly by environmental pollution and an aging population-can be seen worldwide. The current projection of more than 12 million patients with PD worldwide by 2040 is only part of the picture given that more than 20% of patients with PD remain undiagnosed. Timely diagnosis and frequent assessment are key to ensure timely and appropriate medical intervention, thus improving the quality of life of patients with PD. Objective: In this paper, we propose a web-based framework that can help anyone anywhere around the world record a short speech task and analyze the recorded data to screen for PD. Methods: We collected data from 726 unique participants (PD: 262/726, 36.1% were women; non-PD: 464/726, 63.9% were women; average age 61 years) from all over the United States and beyond. A small portion of the data (approximately 54/726, 7.4%) was collected in a laboratory setting to compare the performance of the models trained with noisy home environment data against high-quality laboratory-environment data. The participants were instructed to utter a popular pangram containing all the letters in the English alphabet, 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' We extracted both standard acoustic features (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and jitter and shimmer variants) and deep learning-based embedding features from the speech data. Using these features, we trained several machine learning algorithms. We also applied model interpretation techniques such as Shapley additive explanations to ascertain the importance of each feature in determining the model's output. Results: We achieved an area under the curve of 0.753 for determining the presence of self-reported PD by modeling the standard acoustic features through the XGBoost-a gradient-boosted decision tree model. Further analysis revealed that the widely used mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features and a subset of previously validated dysphonia features designed for detecting PD from a verbal phonation task (pronouncing 'ahh') influence the model's decision the most. Conclusions: Our model performed equally well on data collected in a controlled laboratory environment and in the wild across different gender and age groups. Using this tool, we can collect data from almost anyone anywhere with an audio-enabled device and help the participants screen for PD remotely, contributing to equity and access in neurological care.",

A collaborated feature bank is created through correlated feature selection, Fisher score feature selection, and mutual information-based feature selection schemes. A detection model on top of the feature bank has been developed using the traditional Naïve Bayes, which proved state of the art. The Naïve Bayes detector on collaborative acoustic features can detect the presence of Parkinson's magnificently with a detection accuracy of 78.97% and precision of 0.926, under the hold-out cross validation. The collaborative feature bank on Naïve Bayes revealed distinguishable results as compared to many other recently proposed approaches. The simplicity of Naïve Bayes makes the system robust and effective throughout the detection process.",

  "abstract": "Background and objective: Automatic voice condition analysis systems to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally based on speech data recorded under acoustically controlled conditions and professional supervision. The performance of these approaches in a free-living scenario is unknown. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of uncontrolled conditions (realistic acoustic environment and lack of supervision) on the performance of automatic PD detection systems based on speech. Methods: A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system is proposed to aid in the detection of PD using speech. The system is based on a server-client architecture. In the server, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms are designed and implemented to discriminate subjects with PD from healthy ones. The Android app allows patients to submit phonations and physicians to check the complete record of every patient. Six different machine learning classifiers are applied to compare their performance on two different speech databases. One of them is an in-house database (UEX database), collected under professional supervision by using the same Android-based smartphone in the same room, whereas the other one is an age, sex and health-status balanced subset of mPower study for PD, which provides real-world data. By applying identical methodology, single-database experiments have been performed on each database, and also cross-database tests. Cross-validation has been applied to assess generalization performance and hypothesis tests have been used to report statistically significant differences. Results: In the single-database experiments, a best accuracy rate of 0.92 (AUC = 0.98) has been obtained on UEX database, while a considerably lower best accuracy rate of 0.71 (AUC = 0.76) has been achieved using the mPower-based database. The cross-database tests provided very degraded accuracy metrics.  Conclusion: The results clearly show the potential of the proposed system as an aid for general practitioners to conduct triage or an additional tool for neurologists to perform diagnosis. However, due to the performance degradation observed using data from mPower study, semi-controlled conditions are encouraged, i.e., voices recorded at home by the patients themselves following a strict recording protocol and control of the information about patients by the medical doctor at charge.

  "abstract": "Diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) via speech is crucial for its non-invasive and convenient data collection. However, the small sample size of PD speech data impedes accurate recognition of PD speech. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-source sparse broad transfer learning (SBTL) method, inspired by incremental broad learning, which balances model learning capability and the overfitting associated with limited sample size of PD speech data. Specifically, SBTL initially leverages a sparse network to preprocess highly overlapping PD speech data, facilitating the identification of intrinsic invariant features between the multi-source auxiliary domain and the target data, which contributes to reducing model complexity. Subsequently, SBTL evaluate transfer effectiveness by virtue of the incremental learning mechanism, adaptively adjusting model structure to ensure the positive transfer of knowledge from the multi-source auxiliary domains to the target domain. Numerous experimental results show that, compared to transfer learning methods for PD diagnosis via speech, SBTL consistently demonstrates significant advantages with a smaller standard deviation, particularly leading by at least 2.58%, 5.71%, 12%, and 14.81% in accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score, respectively. Even when compared to some well-known transfer learning methods, SBTL still exhibits significant advantages in most cases while maintaining comparable sensitivity. These demonstrate that SBTL is an effective, efficient, and stable multi-source transfer learning method for PD speech recognition, giving more accurate assistance information for clinicians on decision-making for PD in practice.",

  "abstract": "Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts motor function and speech patterns. Early detection of PD through non-invasive methods, such as speech analysis, can improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model that uses speech recordings and acoustic features to predict PD. Methods: A dataset of speech recordings from individuals with and without PD was analyzed. The dataset includes features such as fundamental frequency (Fo), jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR), and non-linear dynamic complexity measures. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets. To address class imbalance, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied. Several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, were implemented and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) metrics. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to explain the models and evaluate feature contributions. Results: The analysis revealed that features related to speech instability, such as jitter, shimmer, and NHR, were highly predictive of PD. Non-linear metrics, including Recurrence Plot Dimension Entropy (RPDE) and Pitch Period Entropy (PPE), also made significant contributions to the model's predictive power. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved the highest performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.98, recall of 0.95, ensuring minimal false negatives. SHAp values highlighted the importance of fundamental frequency variation and harmonic-to-noise ratio in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals. Conclusion: The developed machine learning model accurately predicts Parkinson's disease using speech recordings, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms demonstrating superior performance. Key predictive features include jitter, shimmer, and non-linear dynamic complexity measures. This study provides a reliable, non-invasive tool for early PD detection and underscores the potential of speech analysis in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases.",

Therefore, we propose a novel multi-source sparse broad transfer learning (SBTL) method, inspired by incremental broad learning, which balances model learning capability and the overfitting associated with limited sample size of PD speech data. Specifically, SBTL initially leverages a sparse network to preprocess highly overlapping PD speech data, facilitating the identification of intrinsic invariant features between the multi-source auxiliary domain and the target data, which contributes to reducing model complexity. Subsequently, SBTL evaluate transfer effectiveness by virtue of the incremental learning mechanism, adaptively adjusting model structure to ensure the positive transfer of knowledge from the multi-source auxiliary domains to the target domain. Numerous experimental results show that, compared to transfer learning methods for PD diagnosis via speech, SBTL consistently demonstrates significant advantages with a smaller standard deviation, particularly leading by at least 2.58%, 5.71%, 12%, and 14.81% in accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score, respectively. Even when compared to some well-known transfer learning methods, SBTL still exhibits significant advantages in most cases while maintaining comparable sensitivity. These demonstrate that SBTL is an effective, efficient, and stable multi-source transfer learning method for PD speech recognition, giving more accurate assistance information for clinicians on decision-making for PD in practice.",

  "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects the aging population, creating a growing burden on global health systems. Early detection of PD is clinically challenging due to the gradual and ambiguous onset of symptoms. Methods: This study presents a machine-learning framework for the early identification of PD using non-invasive biomedical voice biomarkers from the UCI Parkinson's dataset. The dataset consists of 195 sustained phonation recordings from 31 participants (23 PD and 8 healthy controls, ages 46-85). The methodology includes subject-level stratified splitting and normalization, along with BorderlineSMOTE to address class imbalance. Initially, an XGBoost model is applied to select the top 10 acoustic features, followed by a Bayesian-optimized XGBoost classifier, with the decision threshold tuned via F1-maximization on validation data. Results: On the held-out test set, the model achieves 98.0% accuracy, 0.97 macro-F1, and 0.991 ROC-AUC. This performance exceeds that of a deep neural network baseline by 4.0 percentage points in accuracy (94.0% to 98.0%), 4.3 percentage points in macro-F1 (92.7% to 97.0%), and 0.050 in AUC (0.941 to 0.991). Compared to a classical SVM, it outperforms by 7.0 percentage points in accuracy (91.0% to 98.0%), 6.5 percentage points in macro-F1 (90.5% to 97.0%), and 0.089 in AUC (0.902 to 0.991). Discussion: Model decisions are elucidated using SHAP, offering global and patient-specific insights into the influential voice features. These findings indicate the feasibility of a non-invasive, scalable, and explainable voice-based tool for early PD screening, highlighting its potential integration into mobile or telehealth diagnostic platforms.",

  "abstract": "Many people suffer from Parkinson's disease globally, a complicated neurological condition caused by the deficiency of dopamine, an organic chemical responsible for regulating movement in individuals. Patients with Parkinson face muscle stiffness or rigidity, tremors, vocal impairment, slow movement, loss of facial expressions, and problems with balance and coordination. As there is no cure for Parkinson, early diagnosis can help prevent the progression of this disease. The study explores the potential of vocal measures as significant indicators for early prediction of Parkinson. Different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT) are used to detect Parkinson using voice measures and differentiate between the healthy and Parkinson patients. The dataset contains 195 vocal recordings from 31 patients. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used for handling class imbalance to improve the performance of the models. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used for feature selection. The study uses different parameters to evaluate the model's classification results. The results highlight RF as the most effective model with an accuracy of 94% and a precision of 94%. In addition, SVM achieves an accuracy score of 92%, and precision of 91%. However, with the PCA method, SVM achieves an accuracy of 89%, 92%, and 87% for RF and DT respectively. This study highlights the significance of using vocal features along with advanced machine learning methods to reliably diagnose Parkinson's disease, considering the challenges associated with early detection.",

  "abstract": "This study is aimed at detecting Parkinson's disease by analyzing voice measurements made using a mobile phone. The key objectives include creating a model that ensures accurate predictions while maintaining interpretability, consistent with the existing literature on Parkinson's disease. We introduce a novel group-wise scaling method to address typical age and biological sex biases in the datasets, demonstrating 9.5% improvement over conventional scaling for three publicly available data sets. We also show the importance of evaluating the developed model on unseen individuals to achieve reliable classification results. The developed model is shown to offer an accuracy of 82% for unseen individuals, surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we offer insights into the decision-making of the model using Shapley additive explanation values. Our analysis reveals that shorter and less variable voiced segments and more variable unvoiced segments, suggesting a monotone voice pattern with frequent pauses, increase the likelihood of classifying the voice as a Parkinson's disease voice. Additionally, greater variability and rate of voiced segments, low variability of unvoiced segments, higher pitch variation, and spectral flux, suggesting continuous phonation and dynamic modulation, correlate with healthy voices. These features align well with the relevant medical literature, confirming our results. The significance of our proposed model lies in its generalizability and reliability for Parkinson's disease detection, potentially decelerating disease progression, reducing healthcare costs, and improving quality of life for patients.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) detection through voice analysis faces two fundamental challenges: traditional machine learning methods lack clinical interpretability due to their correlational nature, while existing causal inference approaches struggle with the high-dimensional, complex relationships inherent in vocal biomarkers. We address these limitations by developing a causal inference framework that establishes interpretable relationships between vocal features and PD diagnosis. Our approach centers on estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of vocal frequency spread using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and backdoor adjustment, implemented through CatBoost for robust nonlinear modeling. To overcome data scarcity constraints, we introduce a Self-Attentive Quantile GAN (SAQ-GAN) that preserves empirical feature distributions through quantile-based transformation and self-attention mechanisms. The framework includes systematic preprocessing for causal validity and comprehensive refutation tests to validate causal assumptions. Experimental evaluation on the Oxford Parkinson's dataset demonstrates that our method achieves 95.03% precision and 97.84% AUC-ROC while providing clinically interpretable causal estimates (ATE = 0.1844, 95% CI: [0.0743, 0.2945]). Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art causal methods and extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining synthetic data augmentation with principled causal inference for medical diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "The advancements in deep learning and their applications in the field of health diagnosis have been very encouraging, therefore providing a better way for healthcare and also in the early detection of many diseases. Large databases of clinical data are accessible. The secondary use of these medical databases for prediction purposes involving deep learning has fueled the excitement of health experts. In this study, a custom deep neural network is employed for the Parkinson's disease (PD) prediction using voice data. Research studies have shown that voice is an early marker for PD detection. We have also employed the resampling technique to handle the class imbalance issue in the dataset along with a feature selection method known as the minimum redundancy maximum relevance to highlight the relevant features in the dataset.Numerous simulations were performed over the proposed deep neural network model to obtain bettergeneralized results.The performance of our proposed model was equated with state-of-the-art methods, applied in recent research, over the same dataset. The results obtained indicated that the proposed model has significantly outperformed all the existing models.Our proposed model achieved the best validation accuracy of99.12%.The values of several performance metrics suggest that the proposed model is highly efficient to accomplish the task of PD detection.",

  "abstract": "A chronic neurodegenerative disorder affecting the motor system is called Parkinson's disease. Cell degeneration results from it over time as it advances slowly. This is one of the most prevalent diseases in society and is difficult to diagnose. The body experiences both motor and non-motor deficits (such as smell and speech) as a result of a dopamine cell shortage in the brain. Speech problems are common among Parkinson's sufferers, as is well documented. When compared to normal individuals, speech signals from Parkinson's sufferers show notable changes. This study proposes to use voice signals' acoustic properties to classify Parkinson's diseases using a deep learning-based approach. First, a genetic algorithm is used for the auditory characteristics in order to identify useful aspects. The ReliefF feature selection approach and the genetic algorithm's performance are also contrasted. The second phase involves feeding the chosen characteristics into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that has been created. An accuracy of 93.29% is attained without feature selection, whereas 97.62% is attained with feature selection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, which affects 2-3% of people under 65 years of age, is the second most prevalent neurological ailment. The neuropathological indicators of Parkinson's disease are intracellular inclusions containing clumps of synuclein and neuronal death in the substantia nigra, which results in striatal dopamine insufficiency. The central and peripheral autonomic nerve systems contain numerous more cell types that are also involved, most likely beginning with the first stages of the disease. Although bradykinesia and other essential motor characteristics are required for clinical diagnosis, Parkinson's disease is also accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms that increase overall disability. Numerous routes and mechanisms, including synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport, and neuroinflammation, are involved in the underlying molecular etiology.

The aim is to classify the Parkinson's disease based on acoustic voice features in dysphonic speech disorder in Parkinson's patients using state of art machine learning algorithms. For this, some of the parametric and nonparametric machine learning techniques were used on voice features dataset. The aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of state of art algorithms such as Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Algorithm to detect Parkinson's disease which gives higher classification accuracy. Data Preprocessing is done on speech attributes and fed into the machine learning models to evaluate the performance. Various performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score are computed for all four machine learning techniques and the results shows that nonparametric models using Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors produces higher classification accuracy of 87.2% and 90.2% compared to parametric models.",

  "abstract": "Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that impairs the body's nervous system pathways. This disruption results in multiple complications related to movement and control, manifesting as symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and impaired coordination. In the initial phases of PD, individuals have trouble with speech and exhibit a slow rate of verbal expression. Dysphonia is seventy to ninety percent of persons with Parkinson's disease report a speech impairment or modification in speech, and it serves as a preliminary indicator of the disease. Consequently, speech can be a crucial modality in the initial phase of Parkinson's disease prediction. In literature, diverse Machine Learning models are employed for Parkinson's disease diagnosis utilizing voice analysis. Challenges such as class imbalance, feature selection, and interpretable predictive analysis still need to be addressed. Furthermore, the precision and reliability of the predictive outcomes are crucial to enhance healthcare services. Consequently, we propose an Explainable balanced Recursive Feature Importance with Logistic Regression (XRFILR) model to address the abovementioned issues. The proposed model extracts the pertinent features using an RFE with a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluates the feature significance in Parkinson's disease prediction using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. We employed the seven machine learning classifiers the model offers to diagnose Parkinson's disease using significant speech data. Among these ML models, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.46%, surpassing existing machine learning techniques.",

We explore two main approaches: (1) using SFMs as frozen feature extractors and, (2) fine-tuning/adapting SFMs for PD detection. We propose a cross-validation-based layer selection methodology to identify the layer effective for PD detection. Additionally, we compare the performance of the layer selection scheme with full fine-tuning and, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results show that layer selection and LoRA-based fine-tuning can perform on par with full fine-tuning, providing a more parameter-efficient alternative. The highest accuracy was achieved by fine-tuning Whisper using LoRA.",

  "abstract": "The absence of highly predictive and readily applicable biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly hinders the diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of the condition. Since up to 90% of PD patients exhibit speech aberrations, however, the use of patient voice as a rapid diagnostic measure has shown significant promise. Past research towards creating voice-based automated diagnostic tools has relied on expert handcrafted audio feature sets that capture patient articulation, phonation, and prosody properties. Not only is there a limited consensus on the ideal contents of a PD audio diagnostic feature set, but also manually selected features may not fully exploit the predictive power of the underlying data. In this study, we demonstrate the benefit of employing VGGish embeddings, a more generalizable and higher throughput feature extraction strategy, for voice-based PD diagnosis. Our top VGGish-based model achieved 87% accuracy for detecting PD and significantly outperformed models trained on multiple handcrafted feature sets, a mel-frequency cepstral coefficient set, as well as an ImageNet pretrained convolutional neural network extraction strategy. VGGish models were also highly competitive with clinically determined UPDRS III-18 speech deterioration ratings for PD diagnosis. These results demonstrate the potential of VGGish embeddings for creating fast and accurate voice-based PD classification models.",

  "abstract": "The lack of dopamine in the human brain is the cause of Parkinson disease (PD) which is a degenerative disorder common globally to older citizens. However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples. The results for BiLSTM shows that even with a holdout of 90%, the model was still able to effectively recognize PD with an average accuracy for ten rounds experiment using 22 features as 82.86%, 97.1%, and 96.37% for original, augmented (Spline) and augmented (Pchip) datasets, respectively. Our results show that proposed data augmentation schemes have significantly (p < 0.001) improved the accuracy of PD recognition on a small dataset using both classical machine learning models and BiLSTM.",

We introduce a novel group-wise scaling method to address typical age and biological sex biases in the datasets, demonstrating 9.5% improvement over conventional scaling for three publicly available data sets. We also show the importance of evaluating the developed model on unseen individuals to achieve reliable classification results. The developed model is shown to offer an accuracy of 82% for unseen individuals, surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we offer insights into the decision-making of the model using Shapley additive explanation values. Our analysis reveals that shorter and less variable voiced segments and more variable unvoiced segments, suggesting a monotone voice pattern with frequent pauses, increase the likelihood of classifying the voice as a Parkinson's disease voice. Additionally, greater variability and rate of voiced segments, low variability of unvoiced segments, higher pitch variation, and spectral flux, suggesting continuous phonation and dynamic modulation, correlate with healthy voices. These features align well with the relevant medical literature, confirming our results. The significance of our proposed model lies in its generalizability and reliability for Parkinson's disease detection, potentially decelerating disease progression, reducing healthcare costs, and improving quality of life for patients.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a long-lasting and progressive brain disorder that disrupts the body's nervous system pathways. This disruption leads to various issues with movement and control, leading to various symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement and coordination. In the early stages of this condition, the patients struggle to speak and also speak slowly. Dysphonia, a speech impairment or alteration in speech, is experienced by 70 to 90 percent of Parkinson's patients and is an early indication of the disease. Hence, speech or voice can be the vital modality for an early stage of PD diagnosis. In literature, various Machine Learning models are implemented for PD diagnosis based on speech data. However, issues like class imbalance, feature selection, and interpretable prediction analysis are not addressed effectively. Moreover, the accurate and trustworthiness of the prediction results are essential for providing better healthcare services. Here, we propose an enhanced Interpretable Feature Ranking XGBoost (IFRX) model to predict early-stage PD diagnosis based on speech data. The proposed model addresses the above-mentioned issues effectively and provides better prediction performance. Using the proposed model, we implemented eight Machine Learning classifiers for PD diagnosis based on speech data. Among these classifiers, the XGBoost approach shows better prediction performance with an accuracy of 96.61%.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the public neuro-degenerative disorders. Speech/voice disorder is considered one of the symptoms at an early stage. Acoustic and speech signal processing methods can potentially evaluate and measure PD-related vocal impairment. The present work proposed a novel feature selection framework using two levels of the feature selection procedure for voice-loss detection in PD patients. At the ﬁrst level selection, the principal component analysis (PCA) and the eigenvector centrality feature selection (ECFS) methods are initially calculated independently, and the selected features from each method are considered as a separated sublist, namely ECFS selected features sublist, and PCA selected features sublist, in the ﬁrst set. Accordingly, the ﬁrst set, which is the ﬁrst level selection set, is generated from the union of these two sublists using the top-selected features from both methods. In the training phase, a second level selection, which forms the second set (which is a subset from the ﬁrst set), is generated to calculate the proposed weight of each selection method. Since in the present work, the ECFS provided superior performance to the PCA in the ﬁrst level selection, the ECFS is applied to the ﬁrst set in order to ﬁnd weight values based on the contribution/ impact of the top-selected PCA- and ECFS- features in the second level. This weight is determined by ﬁnding a proposed ratio, which is multiplied directly by the selected ECFS features in the ﬁrst level. The selected weighted ECFS features are then combined with the same PCA features to avoid ignoring any of the top-ranked features from the ﬁrst level. This combination includes the ﬁnal weighted-hybrid selected features that fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer to evaluate the proposed weighted hybrid selected features. Hence, in the test phase, the generated weight is used directly without any further need for the second level selection. Several comparative studies were conducted to evaluate the proposed feature selection performance for PD voice-loss detection. The experimental results established the superiority of the proposed procedure using cubic kernel-SVM with 94% accuracy for voiceloss detection in PD, while, with the same classiﬁer, 88% accuracy was achieved without using the proposed selection method.",

  "abstract": "Millions of people worldwide have developed Parkinson's disease (PD), which is more common by 50. Advances in information technology, especially in the field of machine learning, are being challenged for the development of early detection algorithms. This helps doctors to detect disease early and more accurately based on data. The available data has large dimensions and features so that the feature selection method can be used. This research paper aims to provide insight by comparing several algorithms for feature selection and PD classification. PD classification can help improve treatment efficiency and save time. The problem that arises is how the classification algorithm can show better and more efficient accuracy results. A large number of datasets is one of the challenges in the development of classification algorithms. The voice input dataset was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. Bagging's algorithm out performed on average 100%, and MLP 96.58%, and RF 92.52%.",

  "abstract": "Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a reduction in dopamine levels in the brain. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This paper proposes an efficient machine learning model for PD detection using voice-based features, which offer a non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible alternative to complex imaging methods. To enhance classification performance and reduce computational complexity, we evaluate three feature selection algorithms — Chi-squared ( \\$\\chi ^{2}\\$ ), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) — and adopt an incremental feature selection approach, where each feature set increment is assessed across five classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To address dataset imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied. Among the evaluated approaches, the ANOVA algorithm yields the most optimal feature set, with the top 10 features enabling the Quadratic SVM to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.86%. The Quadratic SVM, optimized for minimal power consumption, is implemented on a Nexys A7 FPGA. This setup achieves a dynamic power consumption of just 23 mW and delivers a performance acceleration of  \\$155 \\times \\$  compared to equivalent computations on a 6th-generation Intel i5 processor.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 10 million people worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the detection of PD remains a complicated task, as no gold standard test has yet been developed to provide an accurate diagnosis. In this context, many recent studies have focused on the automatic detection and progression tracking of PD from voice-related characteristics, being feature engineering the most common approach. This work intends to address an existing research gap by introducing a novel strategy that analyzes raw voice waveforms. Despite recent advancements, one of the signiﬁcant hurdles is still the lack of extensive and diverse datasets. This article also implements a data augmentation solution. Big Vocoder Slicing Adversarial Network (BigVSAN) is used to generate synthetic voice data that mimics the characteristics of real patients and healthy subjects. For the PD detection task, deep learning models such as ResNet, LSTM-FCN, InceptionTime, and CDIL-CNN are used. The experiments were performed using the speech task of sustained vowel /a/ in the PC-GITA database, which contains the recordings of healthy and PD subjects. CDIL-CNN achieves the best results, improving the accuracy by 15.87% (8.96%) compared to the model that does not use augmented data (from the best method found in the literature that uses voice waveforms). The results of this study indicate that models trained with raw waveforms showcase modest but promising performance, underlying the potential of audio analysis to improve the early detection of PD, providing a non-invasive and potentially remotely applicable method.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central nervous system that causes tremors and affects movement. Symptoms usually appear gradually over time. Researchers are seeking biomarkers for Parkinson's disease in the hopes of allowing for earlier detection and more tailored treatments to slow the disease's progression. Existing methods of diagnosis include Blood tests, MRI scans, and PET scans. However, these are highly time and resource-consuming. PD also shows an amble change in the voice patterns of a person. Hence, acoustic analysis of voice signals can indicate the progression of PD. This can be analysed using a trained classiﬁer model, which provides an easy diagnosis of the disease. This paper analyses the performance of AI-ML models viz- Linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbourhood (KNN), Random Forest, and XG Boost for the detection of Parkinson's disease using vocal feature sets. Experimental evaluations show that the Random Forest model produced an impressive accuracy of 100%. The classiﬁcation algorithms' accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mathews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) are all examined. The Random Forest classiﬁers are 100% accurate, with an accuracy of 1.000, recall of 1.000, F1-score of 1.000, and MCC of 1.000. Implementing dimensionality reduction using the Eigen approach (Principal Component Analysis) and the dataset combination are the critical reasons for the reported high accuracy. The potential of this methodology is prominent as it can be used to diagnose various other diseases, such as asthma, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.",

  "abstract": "Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.",

  "abstract": "This study is aimed at detecting Parkinson's disease by analyzing voice measurements made using a mobile phone. The key objectives include creating a model that ensures accurate predictions while maintaining interpretability, consistent with the existing literature on Parkinson's disease. We introduce a novel group-wise scaling method to address typical age and biological sex biases in the datasets, demonstrating 9.5% improvement over conventional scaling for three publicly available data sets. We also show the importance of evaluating the developed model on unseen individuals to achieve reliable classification results. The developed model is shown to offer an accuracy of 82% for unseen individuals, surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we offer insights into the decision-making of the model using Shapley additive explanation values. Our analysis reveals that shorter and less variable voiced segments and more variable unvoiced segments, suggesting a monotone voice pattern with frequent pauses, increase the likelihood of classifying the voice as a Parkinson's disease voice. Additionally, greater variability and rate of voiced segments, low variability of unvoiced segments, higher pitch variation, and spectral flux, suggesting continuous phonation and dynamic modulation, correlate with healthy voices. These features align well with the relevant medical literature, confirming our results. The significance of our proposed model lies in its generalizability and reliability for Parkinson's disease detection, potentially decelerating disease progression, reducing healthcare costs, and improving quality of life for patients.",

  "abstract": "Among all the diseases that nowadays people all around the world suffer, Parkinson's Disease is one of those neuro-degenerative disorders heavily impacting, and unfortunately expected to increase, the well-being of, especially, elderly individuals. Besides traditional medical treatments, timely and unobtrusive ways to accurately detect the onset of this disease can rely on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, also because of their ability to efficiently extract information from multi-dimensional data on heterogeneous platforms (including, for instance, constrained Internet of Things devices). This paper presents an experimental performance evaluation of several floating point and quantized ML and DL models which can be deployed efficiently on a tiny micro-controller, namely a STM32U5 micro controller device (available in the STMicroelectronics device cloud). They have been applied to a public Italian voice speech dataset in order to classify the Parkinson Disease in three classes of patients. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of Neural Network (NN)-based approaches for detecting the disease, as well as the deployability of traditional ML models on tiny resource-constrained devices, allowing a substantial flash memory usage reduction (when compared to non-quantized models) while keeping relatively high accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.",

Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.",

This study aims to provide a software solution, focused initially towards Parkinson's disease, which can positively impact medical practice surrounding degenerative diagnoses. Through the use of a dataset containing numerical data representing acoustic features extracted from an audio recording of an individual, it is determined if a neural approach can provide an improvement over previous results in the area. This is achieved through the implementation of a feedforward neural network and a layer recurrent neural network. By comparison with the state-of-the-art, a Bayesian approach providing a classiﬁcation accuracy benchmark of 87.1%, it is found that the implemented neural networks are capable of average accuracy of 96%, highlighting improved accuracy for the classiﬁcation process. The solution is capable of supporting the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in an advisory capacity and is envisioned to inform the process of referral through general practice.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that has affected millions of people worldwide and is more prevalent in older people. Early detection of this disease remains a challenging task. Recently, vocal and speech data are widely used to detect this disease. In this study, we proposed two classification schemes for improving the identification accuracy of PD cases from voice measurements. First, we applied a variable adaptive moment-based backpropagation algorithm of ANN called BPVAM. Then, we investigated the combination of dimensionality reduction method using principal component analysis (PCA) with BPVAM for classification of the same dataset. The main objective was improving the prediction of PD in the early stages by increasing the sensitivity of the system to dealing with data in its fine detail. In experiments, it was proved that robustness of the system was improved by including features with largest variances using PCA which helped the model to learn the patterns earlier in the training process. Results indicated that BPVAM-PCA was relatively more effective than BPVAM. In addition, these methods were also compared with some other well-known algorithms.",

As a consequence, its early diagnosis is of major importance for the improvement of life quality, implying that the severe symptoms can be delayed through appropriate clinical intervention and treatment. Among the most important premature symptoms of PD are the voice impairments of articulation, phonation and prosody. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the voice's dynamic behavior can be used as possible indicator for PD. Thus in this work, we employ the recurrence plots (RPs) which derive from the analysis of the three modulated vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/, which belong to the PC-GITA dataset, and are fed as input images to a 3-channel Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) architecture, which, finally, differentiates the 50 PD patients from 50 healthy subjects. The experimental results obtained provide evidence that the RP-based approach is a promising tool for the recognition of PD patients through the analysis of voice recordings, with a classification accuracy achieved equal to 87%.",

  "abstract": "Proper classification between normal and Parkinson affected people is an important topic in recent years. From the last two decades, the number of methods has been proposed for the classification of Parkinson's affected and healthy people. Most of them based on a shallow structured network classifier. In this study stacked auto-encoder deep neural network framework is introduced to classify Parkinson affected and healthy people voice signals. The present study uses a spectrogram and scalogram of speech signals as input to the stacked autoencoder deep network. The extracted features are tested with a support vector classifier (SVM) and a Softmax classifier. Highest classification accuracy of up to 87 % with a spectrogram and 83 % with scalogram are obtained using Softmax classifier. The softmax classifier performed better than SVM. The proposed deep neural network may be a new window for further research.",

  "abstract": "Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological diseases. At present, because the exact cause is still unclear, accurate diagnosis and progression monitoring remain challenging. In recent years, exploring the relationship between PD and speech impairment has attracted widespread attention in the academic world. Most of the studies successfully validated the effectiveness of some vocal features. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of speech signal-based testing has pioneered a new way for telediagnosis and telemonitoring. In particular, there is an increasing demand for artificial intelligence-powered tools in the digital health era. Objective: This study aimed to build a real-time speech signal analysis tool for PD diagnosis and severity assessment. Further, the underlying system should be flexible enough to integrate any machine learning or deep learning algorithm. Methods: At its core, the system we built consists of two parts: (1) speech signal processing: both traditional and novel speech signal processing technologies have been employed for feature engineering, which can automatically extract a few linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, and (2) application of machine learning algorithms: some classical regression and classification algorithms from the machine learning field have been tested; we then chose the most efficient algorithms and relevant features. Results: Experimental results showed that our system had an outstanding ability to both diagnose and assess severity of PD. By using both linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, the accuracy reached 88.74% and recall reached 97.03% in the diagnosis task. Meanwhile, mean absolute error was 3.7699 in the assessment task. The system has already been deployed within a mobile app called No Pa. Conclusions: This study performed diagnosis and severity assessment of PD from the perspective of speech order detection. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms indirectly validated the practicality of the system. In particular, the system reflects the necessity of a publicly accessible PD diagnosis and assessment system that can perform telediagnosis and telemonitoring of PD. This system can also optimize doctors' decision-making processes regarding treatments.",

The result of syndrome is the patient is not able to do the activities like talking, strolling, and tremor during motion. Normally the physicist identified this disease using two scales are Hoehn and Yahr scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. There are so many features in the dataset. Audio signal is one of features taken in the dataset from UCI dataset repository. Parkinson's disease patient has a low-volume noise with a monotone quality. In This system different audio signals like jitter, simmer, New Human Revolution (NHR), Multidimensional Voice Program (MDVP) are given as a train and test data. MinmaxScale method is used for preprocessing the data. Threshold value and correction coefficient of audio data are played as a parameters of feature selection. The Machine Learning classifiers are utilized to identify the disease. In our model we employed Logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers for classification. Among twenty one features only twelve played as an important role for predicting the disease. The system has achieved result in predicting whether the Parkinson's disease patient is healthy or not. The performance of machine learning classifier XGBoost provided the accuracy of 96% and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 89%.",

  "abstract": "Parkinsons disease is a neural degenerative disease. It slowly progresses from mild to severe stage, resulting in the degeneration of dopamine cells of neurons. Due to the deficiency of dopamine cells in the brain, it leads to a motor (tremor, slowness, impaired posture) and non-motor (speech, olfactory) defects in the body. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is a difficult chore as the symptoms of disease appear overtime. However, different diagnostic systems have contributed towards disease detection by considering gait, tremor and speech characteristics. Recent work has shown that speech impairments can be considered as a possible predictor for Parkinson's disease classification and remains an open research area. The speech signals show major differences and variations for Parkinson patients as compared to normal human beings. Therefore, variation in speech should be modeled using acoustic features to identify these variations. In this research, we propose three methods- the first method employs a transfer learning-based approach using spectrograms of speech recordings, the second method evaluates deep features extracted from speech spectrograms using machine learning classifiers and the third method evaluates simple acoustic feature of recordings using machine learning classifiers. The proposed frameworks are evaluated on a Spanish dataset pc-Gita. The results show that the second framework shows promising results with deep features. The highest 99.7% accuracy on vowel \\o\\ and read text is observed using a multilayer perceptron. Whereas 99.1% accuracy observed on vowel \\o\\ deep features using random forest. The deep feature-based method performs better as compared to simple acoustic features and transfer learning approaches. The proposed methodology outperforms the existing techniques on the pc-Gita dataset for Parkinson's disease detection.",

Excitation source features, voice quality features and prosodic features are the speech constituents considered. Voice samples of PD patients are extracted from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Parkinson's database. Random Forest (RF) decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are considered for classification. Feature reduction is applied with the Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) attribute selector classifier that utilizes Best First Selector (BFS) as a search algorithm. The work involves recognizing a PD patient from a healthy individual using only two speech sounds of /a/ and /o/. The speech sounds are extracted without the association of a certified clinician, that adds novelty. The proposed algorithm is non-invasive and accomplished 94.77% accuracy with feature selection process and applying RF classifier.",

  "abstract": "The Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm which identifies Parkinson disease symptoms at an early (premature) stage was proposed. Parkinson disease, type of movement ailment, could be life-threatening if not treated at premature stage. Therefore, diagnosis of Parkinson disease became essential in early stages so that all the symptoms could be controlled by giving required medication to the patient. Hence ensuring the patient longevity. As part of this research work, a novel model Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm was introduced which was based on the traditional Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm and search strategy for feature selection. Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm was relatively a novel heuristic optimization swarm intelligence algorithm which was stimulated by grasshoppers searching for food. This population-based method has capability to provide solution for real-life problems in undefined search space. It mimics grasshopper swarm's behaviour and their social interaction. Popular algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbour classifier were used in judgement on shortlisted aka selected features. Different datasets of handwriting (meander and spiral), speech and voice were used for evaluating the presented model. The proposed algorithm was effective in Parkinson disease identification having accuracy (computed) of 95.37%, 99.47% detection rate and 15.78% false alarm rate. This helps larger cause of patient in receiving treatment in pre-mature stage. The presented bio-inspired algorithm was adequately steady and has ability to identify the optimal feature set. Finally results obtained from the assessment of introduced Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm on these data sets were evaluated and contrasted with respect to outcome of Modified Grey Wolf Optimizer and Optimized Cuttlefish Algorithm. The experiment's outcome revealed that the presented Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm assists in reducing the selected features count and improving the accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological diseases. At present, because the exact cause is still unclear, accurate diagnosis and progression monitoring remain challenging. In recent years, exploring the relationship between PD and speech impairment has attracted widespread attention in the academic world. Most of the studies successfully validated the effectiveness of some vocal features. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of speech signal-based testing has pioneered a new way for telediagnosis and telemonitoring. In particular, there is an increasing demand for artificial intelligence-powered tools in the digital health era. Objective: This study aimed to build a real-time speech signal analysis tool for PD diagnosis and severity assessment. Further, the underlying system should be flexible enough to integrate any machine learning or deep learning algorithm. Methods: At its core, the system we built consists of two parts: (1) speech signal processing: both traditional and novel speech signal processing technologies have been employed for feature engineering, which can automatically extract a few linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, and (2) application of machine learning algorithms: some classical regression and classification algorithms from the machine learning field have been tested; we then chose the most efficient algorithms and relevant features. Results: Experimental results showed that our system had an outstanding ability to both diagnose and assess severity of PD. By using both linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, the accuracy reached 88.74% and recall reached 97.03% in the diagnosis task. Meanwhile, mean absolute error was 3.7699 in the assessment task. The system has already been deployed within a mobile app called No Pa. Conclusions: This study performed diagnosis and severity assessment of PD from the perspective of speech order detection. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms indirectly validated the practicality of the system. In particular, the system reflects the necessity of a publicly accessible PD diagnosis and assessment system that can perform telediagnosis and telemonitoring of PD. This system can also optimize doctors' decision-making processes regarding treatments.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is found as a progressive neurodegenerative condition which affects motor circuit by the loss of up to 70% of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, diagnosing the early stages of incidence is of great importance. In this article, a novel chaos-based stochastic model is proposed by combining the characteristics of chaotic firefly algorithm with Kernel-based Naive Bayes (KNB) algorithm for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at an early stage. The efficiency of the model is tested on a voice measurement dataset that is collected from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dynamics of chaos optimization algorithm will enhance the firefly algorithm by introducing six types of chaotic maps which will increase the diversification and intensification capability of chaos-based firefly algorithm. The objective of chaos-based maps is to select initial values of the population of fireflies and change the value of absorption coefficient so as to increase the diversity of populations and improve the search process to achieve global optima avoiding the local optima. For selecting the most discriminant features from the search space, Naive Bayesian stochastic algorithm with kernel density estimation as learning algorithm is applied to evaluate the discriminative features from different perspectives, namely, subset size, accuracy, stability, and generalization. The experimental study of the problem established that chaos-based logistic model overshadowed other chaotic models. In addition, four widely used classifiers such as Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and radial basis function classifier are used to prove the generalization and stability of the logistic chaotic model. As a result, the model identified as the best one and could be used as a decision making tool by clinicians to diagnose Parkinson's disease patients.",

  "abstract": "Throughout recent years, the progress of telemonitoring and telediagnostics devices for evaluating and tracking Parkinson's (PD) disease has become increasingly important. The early detection of PD increases the consistency of the treatment of patients and ultimately allows it possible to achieve a rapid diagnostic decision from an experienced clinician. In this paper, a proposed fog-based ANFIS+PSOGWO model provided for Parkinson's disease prediction. The proposed model exploits the advantages of the grey wolf optimization (GWO) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for adjusting the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) parameters with the use of chaotic tent map for the initialization. The fog processing utilized for gathering and analyzing the data at the edge of the gateways and notifying the local community instantly. Compared to other optimization methods, many evaluation metrics used like the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean square error (MSE), the standard deviation (SD), and the accuracy and five standard datasets from repository of UCI machine learning that demonstrated the superiority of the model proposed against the grey wolf optimization (GWO), the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the differential evolution (DE), the genetic algorithm (GA), the ant colony optimization (ACO), and the standard ANFIS model. Moreover, the proposed ANFIS+PSOGWO applied for Parkinson's disease prediction and achieved an accuracy of 87.5%. The proposed ANFIS+PSOGWO compared in producing positive outcomes better than PSO, GWO, GA, ACO, DE, and some recent literature for Parkinson's disease prediction. The proposed model produced accuracy for the Parkinson's disease prediction has outperformed its closest competitors in all algorithms by 7.3%.",

  "abstract": "The Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm which identifies Parkinson disease symptoms at an early (premature) stage was proposed. Parkinson disease, type of movement ailment, could be life-threatening if not treated at premature stage. Therefore, diagnosis of Parkinson disease became essential in early stages so that all the symptoms could be controlled by giving required medication to the patient. Hence ensuring the patient longevity. As part of this research work, a novel model Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm was introduced which was based on the traditional Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm and search strategy for feature selection. Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm was relatively a novel heuristic optimization swarm intelligence algorithm which was stimulated by grasshoppers searching for food. This population-based method has capability to provide solution for real-life problems in undefined search space. It mimics grasshopper swarm's behaviour and their social interaction. Popular algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbour classifier were used in judgement on shortlisted aka selected features. Different datasets of handwriting (meander and spiral), speech and voice were used for evaluating the presented model. The proposed algorithm was effective in Parkinson disease identification having accuracy (computed) of 95.37%, 99.47% detection rate and 15.78% false alarm rate. This helps larger cause of patient in receiving treatment in pre-mature stage. The presented bio-inspired algorithm was adequately steady and has ability to identify the optimal feature set. Finally results obtained from the assessment of introduced Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm on these data sets were evaluated and contrasted with respect to outcome of Modified Grey Wolf Optimizer and Optimized Cuttlefish Algorithm. The experiment's outcome revealed that the presented Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm assists in reducing the selected features count and improving the accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), one of whose symptoms is dysphonia, is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The use of outdated diagnosis techniques, which yield inaccurate and unreliable results, continues to represent an obstacle in early-stage detection and diagnosis for clinical professionals in the medical field. To solve this issue, the study proposes using machine learning and deep learning models to analyze processed speech signals of patients' voice recordings. Datasets of these processed speech signals were obtained and experimented on by random forest and logistic regression classifiers. Results were highly successful, with 90% accuracy produced by the random forest classifier and 81.5% by the logistic regression classifier. Furthermore, a deep neural network was implemented to investigate if such variation in method could add to the findings. It proved to be effective, as the neural network yielded an accuracy of nearly 92%. Such results suggest that it is possible to accurately diagnose early-stage PD through merely testing patients' voices. This research calls for a revolutionary diagnostic approach in decision support systems, and is the first step in a market-wide implementation of healthcare software dedicated to the aid of clinicians in early diagnosis of PD.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, which affects the neurological system of patients, is the second most common neurodegenerative ailment after Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease is most common in adults over sixty and advances slowly. Parkinson's disease symptoms are mild in the early stages and may go unnoticed, but as the disease advances, the symptoms get more severe, and its diagnosis at an early stage is not easy. Recent studies have revealed that alterations in speech or voice distortion can be used to diagnose Parkinson's disease, because it develops as an early symptom in Parkinson's disease patients. The authors propose a technique for detecting Parkinson's disease using speech signals in this paper. As feature selection plays a vital role during classification, the authors have proposed a hybrid MIRFE feature selection approach based on mutual information gain and recursive feature elimination methods. A Parkinson's disease classification dataset consisting of 756 voice measures of 252 individuals was used in this study. The proposed feature selection approach is compared with the five standard feature selection methods by random forest and XGBoost classifier. The proposed MIRFE approach selects 40 features out of 754 features, with a feature reduction ratio of 94.69%. An accuracy of 93.88% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.978 are obtained by the proposed system, which is higher than some recent work.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common diseases of the nervous system, which although typically develops after age 50, in some cases it also affects younger individuals. Its diagnosis is mainly based on the analysis of symptoms, it affects movement, coordination, and muscle control. Doctors generally analyse tremors, stiffness, slow movement, and difficulty walking as symptoms of the disease. Furthermore, changes in the voice are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease, although such changes are not easily noticeable at an early stage. The disease can change your breathing, tone of voice, or lower the volume by up to 10 decibels. Therefore, speech recognition can introduce a new methodology of investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease. This study aims at the development of a model based on the use of Neural Networks for the diagnosis of the disease on voice recordings of different nature, made by both healthy and sick patients. In particular, three types of networks were used: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one and two dimensions. The results are very satisfactory, highlighting the excellent performance of the LSTM with an F-Score of 97%. These results are very encouraging, suggesting that the use of the proposed approach can improve the Parkinson's diagnostic, making it less costly in terms of time and effort.",

  "abstract": "Smartphone-based digital biomarker (DB) assessments provide objective measures of daily-life tasks and thus hold the promise to improve diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, little is known about which tasks perform best for these purposes and how different confounds including comorbidities, age and sex affect their accuracy. Here we systematically assess the ability of common self-administered smartphone-based tasks to differentiate PD patients and healthy controls (HC) with and without accounting for the above confounds. Using a large cohort of PD patients and healthy volunteers acquired in the mPower study, we extracted about 700 features commonly reported in previous PD studies for gait, balance, voice and tapping tasks. We perform a series of experiments systematically assessing the effects of age, sex and comorbidities on the accuracy of the above tasks for differentiation of PD patients and HC using several machine learning algorithms. When accounting for age, sex and comorbidities, the highest balanced accuracy on hold-out data (73%) was achieved using random forest when combining all tasks followed by tapping using relevance vector machine (67%). Only moderate accuracies were achieved for other tasks (60% for balance, 56% for gait and 53% for voice data). Not accounting for the confounders consistently yielded higher accuracies of up to 77% when combining all tasks. Our results demonstrate the importance of controlling DB data for age and comorbidities.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-symptom neurodegenerative disease. There are no biomarkers; the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease progression require clinical and functional symptom observation. Voice impairment is an early symptom of PD, and computerized analysis of voice has been proposed for early detection and monitoring of the disease. However, there is poor reproducibility of many studies, which is attributed to the experimental data having been collected under controlled conditions. To overcome the limitations of earlier works, this study has investigated three sustained phonemes: /a/, /o/, and /m/, which were recorded using an iOS-based smartphone from 72 participants (36 people with PD and 36 healthy) in a typical clinical setting. A number of signal features were obtained, statistically investigated, and ranked to identify the suitable feature sets. These were classified using machine learning models. The results show that a combination of phonemes /a/+/o/+/m/ was most suited to differentiate the voice of PD people from healthy control participants, with an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100%, 100%, 100%, respectively, using leave-one-out validation. The findings of this study could assist in the clinical assessments and remote telehealth monitoring for people with parkinsonian dysarthria using smartphones.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most destructive diseases to the nervous system. Speech disorder is one of the typical symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Approximately 90% of Parkin-son's patients develop some degree of speech disorder, which affects speech function faster than any other subsystem of the body. Screening Parkinson's disease by sound is a very effective method that has attracted a growing number of researchers over the past decade. Patients with Parkinson's disease could be identified by recording the sound signal of the pronunciation of words, extracting appropriate features and identifying the disturbance in their voices. This paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm combined with a data enhancement method for Parkinson's speech signal recognition. Specifically, the methods first extract representative speech signal features through the L1 regularization SVM and then enhance the representative feature data by the SMOTE algorithm. Following this, both original and enhanced features are used to train an SVM classifier for speech signal recognition. An improved genetic algorithm was applied to find the optimal parameters of the SVM. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated by using Parkinson's disease audio data set from the UCI machine learning library, and compared with the most advanced methods, our proposed method has the best performance.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that severely impacts the motor capabilities of patients. Dysarthria is one of the symptoms that can be accurately characterized using speech analysis, tracking the deterioration associated with the evolution of the disease. Through the present work the use of machine learning-based technologies, more speciﬁcally the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the direct application of formant features extracted form sustained phonations of vowel /a/ are proposed. The main goal is to investigate the eﬀects of the speech articulatory movements aﬀected by hypokinetic dysarthria in Parkinson's Disease as this would allow to use speech as a reliable monitoring tool. The study employs voice recording of 593 subjects form the Patient Voice Analysis dataset (PVA) and 687 health controls from the Saarbrücken Voice Database (SVD). The k-fold crossvalidation trials provided the best results when the length of the utterances is limited to 2 s, achieving a sensibility of 0.96 and a speciﬁcity of 0.99.",

  "abstract": "Speech production disorders during Parkinson's Disease (PD) stand for one of the clinical markers which are representative of the evolution of motor and cognitive disability. Neurologists and scientists are currently searching for non-medical methods relying on speech signal analysis to control the assessment of speech disorders in Parkinsonian patients. In this research work, we propose a speech processing approach for early Parkinson disease diagnosis. In order to elaborate this work, we suggest using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a machine learning method to classify data. Our database contains voice recordings of healthy people and PD patients. As far as this study is concerned, we set forward three types of features. Firstly, we invest the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Secondly, we use the deep features selected by AutoEncoder (AE). Finally, we introduce novel characteristics based on Gaussian Mixture Models-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) to extract the MFCC-GMM features. Our proposed characteristics: deep features-based AutoEncoder and MFCC-GMM, always present the highest detection accuracy 99% and 100%. This proves that our approach based on speech can detect the PD without having a medical test.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a nervous system disorder first described as a neurological condition in 1817. It is one of the more prevalent diseases in the elderly, and Alzheimer's is the second most common neurodegenerative illness. It impacts the patient's movement. Symptoms start gradually with tremors, stiffness in movement, and speech and voice disorders. Researches proved that 89% of patients with Parkinson's has speech disorder including uncertain articulation, hoarse and breathy voice and monotone pitch. The cause behind this voice change is the reduction of dopamine due to damage of neurons in the substantia nigra responsible for dopamine production. In this work, Parkinson's disease is classified with the help of human voice signals. Six different machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in the classification: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classifier, and Decision Tree (DT) Classifier. This research aims to classify Parkinson's disease using human voice signals and extract essential features to reduce the complexity of the dataset. Then, human voice signals are analyzed to check the voice intensity and spectrum for PD patients. Then, machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the PD patients based on the extracted features. The results show that SGD-Classifier has 91% accuracy, XGB-Classifier has 95% accuracy, Logistic Regression has 91% accuracy, Random Forest shows 97% accuracy, KNN shows 95% accuracy, and Decision Tree has 95% accuracy. Hence, Random Forest has the highest accuracy. The disease can be studied more by looking for more characteristics of PD patients to enhance its proper use in the medical field.",

  "abstract": "Purpose Conventional diagnostic techniques, on the other hand, may be prone to subjectivity since they depend on assessment of motions that are often subtle to individual eyes and hence hard to classify, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis. Meanwhile, early nonmotor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be mild and may be due to variety of other conditions. As a result, these signs are usually ignored, making early PD diagnosis difficult. Machine learning approaches for PD classification and healthy controls or individuals with similar medical symptoms have been introduced to solve these problems and to enhance the diagnostic and assessment processes of PD (like, movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). Design/methodology/approach Medical observations and evaluation of medical symptoms, including characterization of a wide range of motor indications, are commonly used to diagnose PD. The quantity of the data being processed has grown in the last five years; feature selection has become a prerequisite before any classification. This study introduces a feature selection method based on the score-based artificial fish swarm algorithm (SAFSA) to overcome this issue. Findings This study adds to the accuracy of PD identification by reducing the amount of chosen vocal features while to use the most recent and largest publicly accessible database. Feature subset selection in PD detection techniques starts by eliminating features that are not relevant or redundant. According to a few objective functions, features subset chosen should provide the best performance. Research limitations/implications In many situations, this is an Nondeterministic Polynomial Time (NP-Hard) issue. This method enhances the PD detection rate by selecting the most essential features from the database. To begin, the data set's dimensionality is reduced using Singular Value Decomposition dimensionality technique. Next, Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) for feature selection; the weight value is a vital parameter for finding the best features in PD classification. Originality/value PD classification is done by using ensemble learning classification approaches such as hybrid classifier of fuzzy K-nearest neighbor, kernel support vector machines, fuzzy convolutional neural network and random forest. The suggested classifiers are trained using data from UCI ML repository, and their results are verified using leave-one-person-out cross validation. The measures employed to assess the classifier efficiency include accuracy, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient.",

  "abstract": "Objective: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with subtle early signs, which, often hinder timely and early diagnosis and treatment. The development of accessible, technology-based methods for longitudinal PD symptoms tracking in daily living, offers the potential for transforming disease assessment and accelerating diagnosis. Methods: A privacy-aware method for classifying patients and healthy controls (HC), on the grounds of speech impairment present in PD, is proposed. Voice features from running speech signals were extracted from passively-captured recordings over voice calls. Language-aware training of multiple- and single-instance learning classifiers was employed to fuse and predict on voice features and demographic data from a multilingual cohort of 498 subjects (392/106 self-reported HC/PD patients). Results: By means of leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the best-performing models yielded 0.69/0.68/0.63/0.83 area under the Receiver Operating haracteristic curve (AUC) for the binary classification of PD patient vs. HC in sub-cohorts of English/Greek/German/Portuguese-speaking subjects, respectively. Out-of sample testing of the best performing models was conducted in an additional dataset, generated by 63 clinically-assessed subjects (24/39 HC/early PD patients). Testing has resulted in 0.84/0.93/0.83 AUC for the English/Greek/German-speaking sub-cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed approach outperforms other methods proposed for anguage-aware PD detection considering the ecological validity of the voice data. Significance: This paper introduces for the first time a high-frequency, privacy-aware and unobtrusive PD screening tool based on analysis of voice samples captured during routine phone calls.",

  "abstract": "The progressive reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the human brain, especially at the substantia nigra is one of the principal causes of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Voice alteration is one of the earliest symptoms found in PD patients. Therefore, the impaired PD subjects' acoustic voice signal plays a crucial role in detecting the presence of Parkinson's. This manuscript presents four distinct decision tree ensemble methods of PD detection on a trailblazing ForEx++ rule-based framework. The Systematically Developed Forest (SysFor) and a Penalizing Attributes Decision Forest (ForestPA) ensemble approaches has been used for PD detection. The proposed detection schemes efficiently identify positive subjects using primary voice signal features, viz., baseline, vocal fold, and time-frequency. A novel feature selection scheme termed Feature Ranking to Feature Selection (FRFS) has also been proposed to combine filter and wrapper strategies. The proposed FRFS scheme encompasses Gel's normality test to rank and selects outstanding features from baseline, time-frequency, and vocal fold feature groups. The SysFor and ForestPA decision forests underneath the ForEx++ rule-based framework on both FRFS feature ranking and subset selection represents Parkinson's detection approaches, which expedite a better overall impact on segregating PD from control subjects. It has been observed that the ForestPA decision forest in the ForEx++ framework on FRFS ranked features proved to be a robust Parkinson's detection scheme. The proposed models deliver the highest accuracy of 94.12% and a lowest mean absolute error of 0.25, resulting in an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.97.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative sicknesses distinguished by motor function impairment. Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis is a complicated job that demands the evaluation of numerous non-motor and motor signs. Throughout the analysis of vocal or speech abnormalities are notable indications that doctors should think. Early diagnosis of PD is essential for preliminary treatment and assisting the doctor to heal and evade the PD's spread in other brain cells and save several lives. So, this study introduces an adaptive expert diagnostic system to predict PD accurately. This suggested system proposes a hybrid methodology: two-stage mutual information and autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction approach with genetically optimized LightGBM (MI-AE-GOLGBM) algorithm, to improve the proposed system's performance and predict the best outcomes. The proposed MI-AE-GOLGBM approach comprises four methodologies: mutual information, autoencoder, genetic algorithm, and LightGBM algorithm, in which mutual information and autoencoder are implemented to form a two-stage dimensionality reduction approach for selecting the informative features from the input dataset and hence producing a reduced dataset with the most significant newly generated features, and genetic algorithm is employed to intelligently optimize the hyperparameters of LightGBM algorithm in which LightGBM algorithm utilizes such newly generated features and the best-optimized hyperparameters provided by the two-stage mutual information and autoencoder-based dimension reduction methods and the genetic algorithm, respectively, to which to classify the PD sufferers and healthy controls and enhance the precision value and reliability of the proposed system. Four different real-world publicly available Parkinson's disease datasets are employed in this proposed research to assess and verify the proposed methodology's performance. This proposed research utilizes different machine learning (ML) algorithms to compare our proposed approach's performance. The outcomes reveal that the proposed methodology can produce the best predictions based on voice data relating to the PD compared to the different ML algorithms.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological illness that affects individuals at the later stage of life. Most patients complain of voice or speech abnormalities during the nascent stage of this disease, and it is difficult to recognize these abnormalities. This creates a need for a speech signal-based Parkinson's detection system to aid clinicians in the diagnosis process. A hybrid Parkinson's disease detection system has been proposed in this research work. Two speech datasets have been used in the design of this system: The first is an Italian Parkinson's Voice & Speech dataset, and the other is Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London dataset. Seventeen acoustic features have been generated from the voice samples available in the datasets using Parselmouth library. In addition, based on the significance of features, the eight most significant features have been used in the design of the model. These features have been selected using genetic algorithm method. Four classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, random forest, and logistic regression, have been used during classification stage. The accuracy, sensitivity, f-measure, specificity, and precision parameters have been used for the analysis of the designed system. The combination of a genetic algorithm-based feature selection approach and logistic regression classifier has given 100% accuracy on Italian Parkinson's Voice & Speech dataset. The same feature extraction and classifier combination on the Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London dataset have attained an accuracy level of 90%. Results have shown that the proposed system has outperformed the system found in the literature.",

  "abstract": "The Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative illness which impairs motor and speech skills, in addition to provoke behavior, mood and thinking changes. It hits, more usually, the elderly population and its diagnosis is done by a clinical exam, by the observation of a patient's symptoms. Since the most notorious symptoms appear in advanced stages of the disease, which makes the treatment more difficult, and that the world is passing through a process of age pyramid inversion, the tendency is that the Parkinson will become a global public health issue. Within this context, proposals for the use of voice signals as a form of early diagnosis of Parkinson's have been achieving results. This work proposes the construction of a tool to aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease using voice signals associated with Machine Learning techniques. Using a set of data with different attributes extracted from the speech of carriers and non-carriers of the pathology, an accuracy of 93.8 % was obtained using a Random Forest algorithm and performing a cross-validation with the k-fold technique.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder which affects the motor system. The automatic detection of PD improves the diagnosis of the disease, and it can be done in a non-invasive manner from speech. In this paper, we investigate the use of an exemplar-based sparse representation (SR) classification approach for detecting PD from speech. Exemplars are speech feature vectors extracted from the training data. The idea is to formulate the detection task as a problem of finding sparse representations of test speech feature vectors with respect to training speech exemplars. The main advantage of using the SR approach instead of conventional machine learning (ML)-based approaches is that the training step-which is time-consuming and sometimes requires unorganized hyper-parameter tuning-is not needed. Furthermore, SRs are more robust to redundancy and noise in the data. In this work, we study SR classification approaches based on two sparse coding models, namely, l1-regularized least squares (l(1)LS) and non-negative least squares (NNLS). We propose a strategy based on class-specific dictionaries for improving performance of the l(1)LS- and NNLS-based SR classification. To investigate the detection performance, the l(1)LS- and NNLS-based approaches are applied and compared with the traditional PD detection approach based on ML classification algorithms using the PC-GITA PD dataset and an openly available dataset consisting of mobile device voice recordings from healthy and PD patients. The results indicate that the proposed NNLS-based SR classification approach performs better than the traditional ML-based methods in discriminating PD patients from healthy subjects.",

  "abstract": "In recent years, the study of machine learning-based speech recognition methods for Parkinson's disease has become a hot topic in recent years. However, existing related machine learning methods focus on feature learning and classifier design, with minute attention to sample optimization. Studies have shown that each subject often includes multiple corpus (segment samples, or samples) with different representational abilities and high redundancy, making it necessary to optimize the segment samples within each subject. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-type transformation ensemble algorithm for PD speech samples based on a subject envelope (MTEA). The proposed algorithm takes the speech samples (segment samples) within a subject as an envelope and performs a multi-type transformation on the segment samples within the envelope to construct new segment samples. The quality of the sample transformation is improved by preserving the local structure and global structure information of the samples through the joint structure consistency mechanism (JSCM). In addition, a sparse weighted fusion mechanism is designed to fuse the results of multiple classifiers. Two representative public datasets and one self-collected dataset are used to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly more effective than the compared algorithms. Besides, the ablation experiments show that the multi-type transformation mechanism is effective. Based on this study, the multi-type transformation of PD speech samples will help improve the quality of the existing segment samples in PD speech data and thereby improve classification accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder impacting a person's speech. Among automatic PD assessment methods, deep learning models have gained particular interest. Recently, the community has explored cross-pathology and cross-language models which can improve diagnostic accuracy even further. However, strict patient data privacy regulations largely prevent institutions from sharing patient speech data with each other. In this paper, we employ federated learning (FL) for PD detection using speech signals from 3 real-world language corpora of German, Spanish, and Czech, each from a separate institution. Our results indicate that the FL model outperforms all the local models in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while not performing very differently from the model based on centrally combined training sets, with the advantage of not requiring any data sharing among collaborators. This will simplify inter-institutional collaborations, resulting in enhancement of patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder impacting a person's speech. Among automatic PD assessment methods, deep learning models have gained particular interest. Recently, the community has explored cross-pathology and cross-language models which can improve diagnostic accuracy even further. However, strict patient data privacy regulations largely prevent institutions from sharing patient speech data with each other. In this paper, we employ federated learning (FL) for PD detection using speech signals from 3 real-world language corpora of German, Spanish, and Czech, each from a separate institution. Our results indicate that the FL model outperforms all the local models in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while not performing very differently from the model based on centrally combined training sets, with the advantage of not requiring any data sharing among collaborators. This will simplify inter-institutional collaborations, resulting in enhancement of patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological illness that affects individuals at the later stage of life. Most patients complain of voice or speech abnormalities during the nascent stage of this disease, and it is difficult to recognize these abnormalities. This creates a need for a speech signal-based Parkinson's detection system to aid clinicians in the diagnosis process. A hybrid Parkinson's disease detection system has been proposed in this research work. Two speech datasets have been used in the design of this system: The first is an Italian Parkinson's Voice & Speech dataset, and the other is Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London dataset. Seventeen acoustic features have been generated from the voice samples available in the datasets using Parselmouth library. In addition, based on the significance of features, the eight most significant features have been used in the design of the model. These features have been selected using genetic algorithm method. Four classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, random forest, and logistic regression, have been used during classification stage. The accuracy, sensitivity, f-measure, specificity, and precision parameters have been used for the analysis of the designed system. The combination of a genetic algorithm-based feature selection approach and logistic regression classifier has given 100% accuracy on Italian Parkinson's Voice & Speech dataset. The same feature extraction and classifier combination on the Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London dataset have attained an accuracy level of 90%. Results have shown that the proposed system has outperformed the system found in the literature.",

  "abstract": "The Digital twin based Healthcare System is a demanding issue that can introduce improvements in the life of the elderly and disabled people living in remote places. More recently, modern Digital twin based Healthcare Systems have gained more attention and invitations from people due to the popularity of smart city establishment along with improvements in various healthcare services adapted in the smart phones. It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learningbased smart predictions over the cloud computing platform. The existing Healthcare System offers service to remote patients through continuous monitoring and tracking of physiological health records without live interaction and portability. Thus, the Digital twin based Healthcare System (DTHS) is proposed with smart virtual care facilities to enhance the earlier states of disease prediction and a patient-centric diagnosis mechanism from remote locations. Particularly, diseases such as Parkinson disease, identified as a severe neuro degenerative disorder worldwide, require such prediction and diagnosis at earlier stages. In this work, the experiments are focusing two voice based data sets namely DS1, and DS2 obtained from Kaggle, and UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed DTHS is developed over the cloud platform for Parkinson disease prediction using the Optimized Fuzzy based k-Nearest Neighbour (OF-k-NN) classifier model. It provides cumulative improvements against the existing Neural Network and Kernel-based SVM classifiers with respect to Prediction Time for DS1 as 0.00127 seconds, and DS2 as 0.00105 seconds, Prediction Accuracy for DS1 as 97.95%, and DS2 received 91.48%, F1-Score 0.98 for DS1, and 0.91 for DS2, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of DS1 got 0.93675, and DS2 received 0.79816.",

  "abstract": "In recent years, the study of machine learning-based speech recognition methods for Parkinson's disease has become a hot topic in recent years. However, existing related machine learning methods focus on feature learning and classifier design, with minute attention to sample optimization. Studies have shown that each subject often includes multiple corpus (segment samples, or samples) with different representational abilities and high redundancy, making it necessary to optimize the segment samples within each subject. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-type transformation ensemble algorithm for PD speech samples based on a subject envelope (MTEA). The proposed algorithm takes the speech samples (segment samples) within a subject as an envelope and performs a multi-type transformation on the segment samples within the envelope to construct new segment samples. The quality of the sample transformation is improved by preserving the local structure and global structure information of the samples through the joint structure consistency mechanism (JSCM). In addition, a sparse weighted fusion mechanism is designed to fuse the results of multiple classifiers. Two representative public datasets and one self-collected dataset are used to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly more effective than the compared algorithms. Besides, the ablation experiments show that the multi-type transformation mechanism is effective. Based on this study, the multi-type transformation of PD speech samples will help improve the quality of the existing segment samples in PD speech data and thereby improve classification accuracy.",

  "abstract": "The Digital twin based Healthcare System is a demanding issue that can introduce improvements in the life of the elderly and disabled people living in remote places. More recently, modern Digital twin based Healthcare Systems have gained more attention and invitations from people due to the popularity of smart city establishment along with improvements in various healthcare services adapted in the smart phones. It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learningbased smart predictions over the cloud computing platform. The existing Healthcare System offers service to remote patients through continuous monitoring and tracking of physiological health records without live interaction and portability. Thus, the Digital twin based Healthcare System (DTHS) is proposed with smart virtual care facilities to enhance the earlier states of disease prediction and a patient-centric diagnosis mechanism from remote locations. Particularly, diseases such as Parkinson disease, identified as a severe neuro degenerative disorder worldwide, require such prediction and diagnosis at earlier stages. In this work, the experiments are focusing two voice based data sets namely DS1, and DS2 obtained from Kaggle, and UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed DTHS is developed over the cloud platform for Parkinson disease prediction using the Optimized Fuzzy based k-Nearest Neighbour (OF-k-NN) classifier model. It provides cumulative improvements against the existing Neural Network and Kernel-based SVM classifiers with respect to Prediction Time for DS1 as 0.00127 seconds, and DS2 as 0.00105 seconds, Prediction Accuracy for DS1 as 97.95%, and DS2 received 91.48%, F1-Score 0.98 for DS1, and 0.91 for DS2, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of DS1 got 0.93675, and DS2 received 0.79816.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder and affects the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. In this paper, we investigated comparative studies on the different scenarios such as AutoEncoder and Ant Colony Optimization feature selection algorithms for the effective features in diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. These algorithms are implemented to the voice dataset obtained from online repository. Then selected features are presented to the Decision tree, SVM, K-NN, Ensemble, Naive Bayes and Discriminant classifiers for each of the binary classification problems. The proposed methods are evaluated with the sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall and accuracy criteria. The proposed systems are trained and tested with these classifiers separately to carry out a comparative study and to analyse the success of feature selection methods in discriminating healthy people and PD patients. In Parkinson's data there are 24 features that obtained from the signal voices. Some of the features in training of the classifier have problems and these problems reduce the accuracy of the system. It is found that for K-NN and Ensemble classification methods both ACO and Autoencoder have the same and the best training performance. Testing results show that accuracy rate of ACO is higher than Autoencoder method.",

  "abstract": "One of the possibilities for developing non-invasive computerized diagnostic tools for Parkinson's disease (PD) is to detect changes in the voice, known as Parkinsonian dysarthria. Numerous classification models have been developed to diagnose PD based on voice features. However, the performance of models developed and trained only using voice features extracted from people with PD and healthy people might be affected when tested on individuals with other voice-related pathological conditions. Therefore, we investigated the reliability of voice-based machine-learning models that were developed only using datasets of people with PD and healthy people for accurately identifying people without PD when they have other voice-related pathological conditions (i.e. dysphonia and laryngitis). Three different support vector machines (SVMs) were developed and tested on voice features extracted from healthy people and those with PD, dysphonia, and laryngitis. The results confirmed that a voice-based SVM classifier only trained on the dataset of people with PD and healthy people was equally reliable in classifying other voice-related pathological conditions, such as dysphonia and laryngitis, as non-PD cases.",

Movement symptoms and imaging techniques are the most popular ways to diagnose this disease. However, they are not accurate and fast and may only be accessible to a few people. This study provides an autonomous system, i.e., PD-ADSV, for diagnosing PD based on voice signals, which uses four machine learning classifiers and the hard voting ensemble method to achieve the highest accuracy. PD-ADSV is developed using Python and the Gradio web framework.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder which affects the motor system. The automatic detection of PD improves the diagnosis of the disease, and it can be done in a non-invasive manner from speech. In this paper, we investigate the use of an exemplar-based sparse representation (SR) classification approach for detecting PD from speech. Exemplars are speech feature vectors extracted from the training data. The idea is to formulate the detection task as a problem of finding sparse representations of test speech feature vectors with respect to training speech exemplars. The main advantage of using the SR approach instead of conventional machine learning (ML)-based approaches is that the training step, which is time-consuming and sometimes requires unorganized hyper-parameter tuning, is not needed. Furthermore, SRs are more robust to redundancy and noise in the data. In this work, we study SR classification approaches based on two sparse coding models, namely, l1-regularized least squares (l1LS) and non-negative least squares (NNLS). We propose a strategy based on class-specific dictionaries for improving performance of the l1LS- and NNLS-based SR classification. To investigate the detection performance, the l1LS- and NNLS-based approaches are applied and compared with the traditional PD detection approach based on ML classification algorithms using the PC-GITA PD dataset and an openly available dataset consisting of mobile device voice recordings from healthy and PD patients. The results indicate that the proposed NNLS-based SR classification approach performs better than the traditional ML-based methods in discriminating PD patients from healthy subjects.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder impacting a person's speech. Among automatic PD assessment methods, deep learning models have gained particular interest. Recently, the community has explored cross-pathology and cross-language models which can improve diagnostic accuracy even further. However, strict patient data privacy regulations largely prevent institutions from sharing patient speech data with each other. In this paper, we employ federated learning (FL) for PD detection using speech signals from 3 real-world language corpora of German, Spanish, and Czech, each from a separate institution. Our results indicate that the FL model outperforms all the local models in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while not performing very differently from the model based on centrally combined training sets, with the advantage of not requiring any data sharing among collaborators. This will simplify inter-institutional collaborations, resulting in enhancement of patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disease that has been reported to have affected most people worldwide. Recent research pointed out that about 90% of PD patients possess voice disorders. Motivated by this fact, many researchers proposed methods based on multiple types of speech data for PD prediction. However, these methods either face the problem of low rate of accuracy or lack generalization. To develop an approach that will be free of these issues, in this paper we propose a novel ensemble approach. These paper contributions are two folds. First, investigating feature selection integration with deep neural network (DNN) and validating its effectiveness by comparing its performance with conventional DNN and other similar integrated systems. Second, development of a novel ensemble model namely EOFSC (Ensemble model with Optimal Features and Sample Dependant Base Classifiers) that exploits the findings of recently published studies. Recent research pointed out that for different types of voice data, different optimal models are obtained which are sensitive to different types of samples and subsets of features. In this paper, we further consolidate the findings by utilizing the proposed integrated system and propose the development of EOFSC. For multiple types of vowel phonations, multiple base classifiers are obtained which are sensitive to different subsets of features. These features and sample-dependent base classifiers are integrated, and the proposed EOFSC model is constructed. To evaluate the final prediction of the EOFSC model, the majority voting methodology is adopted. Experimental results point out that feature selection integration with neural networks improves the performance of conventional neural networks. Additionally, feature selection integration with DNN outperforms feature selection integration with conventional machine learning models. Finally, the newly developed ensemble model is observed to improve PD detection accuracy by 6.5%.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurological condition that occurs when dopamine production in the brain decreases significantly due to the degeneration of neurons in an area called the substantia nigra. One of its characteristics is the slow and gradual onset of symptoms, which are varied and include tremors at rest, rigidity, and slow speech. Voice changes are very common among patients, so analysis of voice recordings could be a valuable tool for early diagnosis of the disease. This study proposes an approach that compares different Machine Learning models for the diagnosis of the disease through the use of vocal recordings of the vowel a made by both healthy and sick patients and the identification of the subset of the most significant features The experiments were conducted on a data set available on the UCI repository, which collects 756 different recordings. The results obtained are very encouraging, reaching an F-score of 95%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is an age-related nervous system disorder that impacts movement of the human body. Cure of this disease is yet unknown, but a patient's quality of life can be improved if it is diagnosed at an early stage. It has been identified by various researchers that voice degradation is a common symptom of this disease. Machine learning is increasingly establishing its place in the healthcare industry. In this paper, we implement and compare state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms like SupportVector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease performance evaluation. The work in this paper proposes using Extra Trees Classifier along with entropybased feature selection which proved superior over all other models for Parkinson's disease prediction. It yields highest accuracy 94.34%, precision 0.9388, F1-score 0.9684, and recall value 1.",

  "abstract": "The Digital twin based Healthcare System is a demanding issue that can introduce improvements in the life of the elderly and disabled people living in remote places. More recently, modern Digital twin based Healthcare Systems have gained more attention and invitations from people due to the popularity of smart city establishment along with improvements in various healthcare services adapted in the smart phones. It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learningbased smart predictions over the cloud computing platform. The existing Healthcare System offers service to remote patients through continuous monitoring and tracking of physiological health records without live interaction and portability. Thus, the Digital twin based Healthcare System (DTHS) is proposed with smart virtual care facilities to enhance the earlier states of disease prediction and a patient-centric diagnosis mechanism from remote locations. Particularly, diseases such as Parkinson disease, identified as a severe neuro degenerative disorder worldwide, require such prediction and diagnosis at earlier stages. In this work, the experiments are focusing two voice based data sets namely DS1, and DS2 obtained from Kaggle, and UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed DTHS is developed over the cloud platform for Parkinson disease prediction using the Optimized Fuzzy based k-Nearest Neighbour (OF-k-NN) classifier model. It provides cumulative improvements against the existing Neural Network and Kernel-based SVM classifiers with respect to Prediction Time for DS1 as 0.00127 seconds, and DS2 as 0.00105 seconds, Prediction Accuracy for DS1 as 97.95%, and DS2 received 91.48%, F1-Score 0.98 for DS1, and 0.91 for DS2, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of DS1 got 0.93675, and DS2 received 0.79816.",

An early detection of Parkinson's disease can help patients get effective treatment before the disease becomes severe. This paper focuses on applying and evaluating different machine learning techniques to predict Parkinson's disease based on patient's voice data. The various algorithms in MATLAB were used to train models, and the better performing models among them were chosen. The chosen algorithms were logistic regression, SVM (linear and quadratic), and weighted KNN. The quadratic SVM classifier performed best among other classifiers to predict Parkinson's disease. The findings of this study could contribute to the development of better diagnostic tools for early prediction of Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive longterm degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The symptoms usually develop slowly, starting with symptoms in the motor system and potentially evolving into non-motor symptoms as the disease worsens. It is estimated that 90% of patients with Parkinson's end up having speech disorders. The following work delves into the domain of classiﬁcation models for Parkinson's disease through speech recordings using machine learning (ML). Diverse datasets were explored including (1) the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech; (2) Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London; (3) Synthetic Vowels of Speakers with Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism; and (4) Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls. Two types of feature extraction are used, incorporating traditional acoustic features (interpretable) and embeddings extracted using pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (noninterpretable): (1) TRILLsson; (2) Wav2Vec 2.0; (3) HuBERT. For the training algorithms, a myriad of methods were used, from simple logistic regression to XGBoost. The two types of features adopted displayed robustness, as the use of interpretable features reached up to 95% accuracy, while non-interpretable embeddings had a top-performing accuracy of 99%, surpassing the state-of-the-art.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's is one of the most rapidly increasing neurological diseases in the world, caused by the deficiency of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Voice disorders are a significant finding in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Detection of this finding at an early stage of the disease allows early treatment of the disease. Therefore, in this study, using sound data, a hybrid model for detecting PD has been designed. In the developed method, first of all, the sound data were converted into spectrograms. Then, the feature maps of the obtained spectrogram images were extracted using 3 different CNN architectures. Feature maps with different features obtained by utilizing the accumulation of different architectures were combined. Then, these features were selected using the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), one of the most recent metaheuristic optimization algorithms, and then classified by support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). One of the important novelties in the study is the reduction of the size of the acquired feature maps with AOA, a new and high-performance metaheuristic approach. The success of the proposed model in diagnosing Parkinson's disease reached up to 98.19%. In addition, feature maps of the sound data in the dataset were acquired by using the MFCC method to compare the performance of the proposed model. Eight different classifiers were used to categorize the acquired feature maps. The highest accuracy value obtained in this method was obtained in the Random Forest classifier with 93.98%.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological disorder that causes significant physical disabilities, decreases the quality of life, and does not have a cure. Because it is a nervous system disorder, it impacts people in different ways, affecting movement and speech and causing muscle stiffness. Approximately, 90% of people with Parkinson's disease have speech disorders. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can mostly be employed for the early detection of diseases to enhance the lifespan and improve the lifestyle of people with chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we have employed an Artificial Neurons Network (ANN) and nineteen ML algorithms to predict people with Parkinson's disease using two different acoustic datasets. Contrary to the train-test split approach, this work aims to utilize the cross-validation technique to estimate the performance. The objective is to ensure that each sample in these small and unbalanced acoustic datasets contributes to both the training and testing processes to provide accurate estimations for the performance of the classifiers on unseen dataset, and to provide a clear insight into the effectiveness of ML algorithms in diagnosing Parkinson's disease via voice disorder. To enhance the performance of the prediction, we employed several techniques such as Optimal Hyperparameters Tuning and Cross-Validation to obtain the best performance and results, and we have provided a detailed explanation of these algorithms' performance and the Optimal Hyperparameters used for each of them. Based on the results and performance, the best classifiers have been selected to build two independent ensemble voting classifiers for the two different datasets. We calculated and represented the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and AUC. They reached 96.41% and 97.35% of accuracy, respectively.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays Parkinson's disease has been discovered that approximately 94% of people suffer from voice disorder problems. A neurodegenerative can identify PD patients through examination and multiple scanning tests. So, it usually takes more time to diagnose the disease at the early stage. Current work has identified that speech disorders can be a significant signal for Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this work proposed a fusion model to identify the speech disorder at the starting stage of the disease. In this process, the author has tested a model with a different pattern of feature selection method as well as classification mode and created a system with the best pattern. For the creation of pattern, three types of feature selection methods namely Chi-square, genetic algorithm and Embedded random forest method and four classifier models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision tree and Random Forest have been utilized. To analyze the performance of the system speech public dataset from the UCI repository,the authors applied the combination of the Embedded random feature selection method and random forest classification algorithm provides 97.89% of accuracy. However, this outcome is better than the recent work. The SMOTE is utilized for the balancing of the dataset.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) arises from brain cell damage and necessitates early detection for effective treatment and symptom management. While various methods such as voice, speech, and written exams have been explored, utilizing automated tools is crucial to enhance accuracy. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) provide an opportunity for precise early-stage PD identification. This study introduces a novel approach known as Quantum Mayfly Optimization-based feature subset selection with hybrid convolutional neural network (QMFOFS-HCNN) to improve PD detection and classification. QMFOFS-HCNN is designed to identify optimal feature subsets and overcome the dimensionality challenge. It combines a quantum mayfly optimization approach for feature selection with a convolutional neural network with attention-based long short-term memory for PD detection and classification. Additionally, hyperparameter selection is optimized using the Nadam optimizer. Experimental validation using benchmark datasets yielded compelling results. The QMFOFS-HCNN technique achieved accuracy rates: 96.35% for HandPD Spiral, 96.7% for HandPD Meander, 98.5% for Speech PD, and a perfect 100% for Voice PD datasets. These quantitative findings underscore the potential of AI and DL to enhance early PD detection accuracy significantly. These results offer promising prospects for improving healthcare outcomes in managing PD and related neurological disorders.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) arises from brain cell damage and necessitates early detection for effective treatment and symptom management. While various methods such as voice, speech, and written exams have been explored, utilizing automated tools is crucial to enhance accuracy. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) provide an opportunity for precise early-stage PD identification. This study introduces a novel approach known as Quantum Mayfly Optimization-based feature subset selection with hybrid convolutional neural network (QMFOFS-HCNN) to improve PD detection and classification. QMFOFS-HCNN is designed to identify optimal feature subsets and overcome the dimensionality challenge. It combines a quantum mayfly optimization approach for feature selection with a convolutional neural network with attention-based long short-term memory for PD detection and classification. Additionally, hyperparameter selection is optimized using the Nadam optimizer. Experimental validation using benchmark datasets yielded compelling results. The QMFOFS-HCNN technique achieved accuracy rates: 96.35% for HandPD Spiral, 96.7% for HandPD Meander, 98.5% for Speech PD, and a perfect 100% for Voice PD datasets. These quantitative findings underscore the potential of AI and DL to enhance early PD detection accuracy significantly. These results offer promising prospects for improving healthcare outcomes in managing PD and related neurological disorders.",

  "abstract": "The analysis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is an inspiring task that necessitates the analysis of numerous motor and non-motor indications. During analysis, some abnormalities are considered as important symptoms to analyze the disease. Hence, this research introduced the proposed chronological smart sunflower optimization Algorithm (CSSFOA) for classifying the PD from voice data and voice signal samples. For voice signal, the input signals are pre-processed by the Gaussian filter, and then the significant features are extracted from it. The selection of optimal features is done by the chronological smart flower optimization Algorithm (CSFOA). The proposed CSFOA-based feature selection method considered the features by the Bray-Curtis distance. The PD classification is done by the ZF-Net which is trained by proposed CSSFOA to increase the performance of classification. The experimental result reveals that the proposed CSSFOA_ZF-Net algorithm got a better testing accuracy of 0.945, a sensitivity of 0.919, and a specificity of 0.957.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological disorder that causes significant physical disabilities, decreases the quality of life, and does not have a cure. Because it is a nervous system disorder, it impacts people in different ways, affecting movement and speech and causing muscle stiffness. Approximately, 90% of people with Parkinson's disease have speech disorders. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can mostly be employed for the early detection of diseases to enhance the lifespan and improve the lifestyle of people with chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we have employed an Artificial Neurons Network (ANN) and nineteen ML algorithms to predict people with Parkinson's disease using two different acoustic datasets. Contrary to the train-test split approach, this work aims to utilize the cross-validation technique to estimate the performance. The objective is to ensure that each sample in these small and unbalanced acoustic datasets contributes to both the training and testing processes to provide accurate estimations for the performance of the classifiers on unseen dataset, and to provide a clear insight into the effectiveness of ML algorithms in diagnosing Parkinson's disease via voice disorder. To enhance the performance of the prediction, we employed several techniques such as Optimal Hyperparameters Tuning and Cross-Validation to obtain the best performance and results, and we have provided a detailed explanation of these algorithms' performance and the Optimal Hyperparameters used for each of them. Based on the results and performance, the best classifiers have been selected to build two independent ensemble voting classifiers for the two different datasets. We calculated and represented the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and AUC. They reached 96.41% and 97.35% of accuracy, respectively.",

  "abstract": "PurposeParkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in the global context. The presently available detecting process of PD is costly and labour-intensive. Along with a movement disorder, PD also affects speech differently. By causing variation in pitch, monotonicity, slurring of words, or slow speed of talking. This study uses different machine learning binary classification algorithms for the detection and classification of PD.MethodsThe publicly available Parkinson's disease speech features dataset is imbalanced, with only 192 healthy instances compared to 564 PD instances. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique - Edited Nearest Neighbours (SMOTE-ENN) algorithms rectify the class imbalance by oversampling and under sampling. Thus, it results in a balanced dataset free of noisy samples. Machine learning binary classifiers, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression are investigated.ResultsThe classification algorithms have been analysed and compared based on several standard evaluation metrics. The classification model, resampling using SMOTE-ENN technique, and dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) have been performed on the dataset to enhance the performance and prevent overfitting. The combination of SMOTE-ENN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) yields a good accuracy of 96.5%.ConclusionSpeech features are a predictive and non-intrusive method, thus making the diagnostic process painless and straightforward. The reported results are promising to aid the diagnosis of PD so that treatment can be administered as early as possible. Thus, the primary findings are beneficial to detect PD at an early stage with optimal accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that millions of people worldwide suffer from. Early symptoms include a slight sense of weakness and a propensity for involuntary tremulous motion in body limbs, particularly in the arms, hands, and head. PD is diagnosed based on motor symptoms. Additionally, scholars have proposed various remote monitoring tests that offer benefits such as early diagnosis, ease of application, and cost-effectiveness. PD patients often exhibit voice disorders. Speech signals of the patients can be used for early diagnosis of the disease. This study proposed an artificial intelligence-based approach for PD diagnosis using speech signals. Scalogram images, generated through the Continuous Wavelet Transform of the speech signals, were employed in deep learning techniques to detect PD. The scalograms were tested with various deep learning techniques. In the first part of the experiment, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, and a majority voting-based hybrid system were used as classifiers. Secondly, a deep feature fusion method based on DenseNet and NasNet was investigated. Several evaluation metrics were employed to assess the performance. The deep feature fusion system achieved an accuracy of 0.95 and an F1 score with stratified 10-fold cross-validation, improving accuracy by 38% over the ablation study. The key contributions of this study include the investigation of scalogram images with a comprehensive analysis of deep learning models and deep feature fusion for PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive longterm degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The symptoms usually develop slowly, starting with symptoms in the motor system and potentially evolving into non-motor symptoms as the disease worsens. It is estimated that 90% of patients with Parkinson's end up having speech disorders. The following work delves into the domain of classiﬁcation models for Parkinson's disease through speech recordings using machine learning (ML). Diverse datasets were explored including (1) the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech; (2) Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London; (3) Synthetic Vowels of Speakers with Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism; and (4) Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls. Two types of feature extraction are used, incorporating traditional acoustic features (interpretable) and embeddings extracted using pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (noninterpretable): (1) TRILLsson; (2) Wav2Vec 2.0; (3) HuBERT. For the training algorithms, a myriad of methods were used, from simple logistic regression to XGBoost. The two types of features adopted displayed robustness, as the use of interpretable features reached up to 95% accuracy, while non-interpretable embeddings had a top-performing accuracy of 99%, surpassing the state-of-the-art.",

  "abstract": "An early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is important for patients' quality of life and current detection methods are not optimal in this task. The search of an automatic, low-cost, non-invasive method would be appropiate to delevope a computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning models based on data such as neural networks are at the core of many of these systems. In this work 5 convolutional neural network architectures have been compared by their capability on classifying spectrograms generated with PCGita database. For this classification task, transfer learning using Saarbrücken Voice Database and a data augmentation technique have been addresed with 14 models from the 5 architectures. After performing 5-fold cross-validation, results show that VGG16 architecture is able to distinguish between healthy and PD spectrograms with around 85% of global accuracy. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this technology with multicondition training in medical environments.",

A variety of efforts are underway to address these issues and improve diagnostic precision in Parkinson's disease. This paper employs well-known machine-learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy. A variety of individual and ensemble AI models have been proposed, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Stacking, and Bagging Ensemble classifiers. Three scenarios are applied to two standard benchmark datasets. The best performance is achieved when the Stacking Ensemble classifier is utilized, where the Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting are engaged for extracting features and Logistic Regression for classifying Parkinson's disease. The Stacking Ensemble classifier reaches 94.87% accuracy and 90.00% AUC for the first dataset, while for the second dataset, 96.18% accuracy and 96.27% AUC are recorded. The final results demonstrate the importance of the suggested framework, which can help to improve the overall diagnosis outcomes.",

The brain's dopamine cells are responsible for movement control, adaptability, and fluidity. Parkinson's motor symptoms manifest when 60-80% of these cells are damaged due to insufficient dopamine. Researchers are working to find a way to identify the non-motor symptoms that manifest early detection in the disease to stop the disease's progression because it is believed that the disease starts many years before the motor symptoms. This research presents Parkinson's disease diagnosis based on deep learning. Processes for feature selection and classification encompass the suggested diagnosis technique. The proposed model searches for the best subset of characteristics using the Improved Glowworm Swarm Optimization (IGSO) algorithm. Radial Basis Functions Networks (RBFN) classifiers evaluate the chosen features. The suggested model is tested using datasets from Parkinson's Handwriting samples and Parkinson's Speech and voice with various sound recordings.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a condition that degenerates over time and impairs speech and pronunciation because brain cells have died. This research work aims to predict parkinson disease using the voice features extracted from speech signals recorded from PD individuals with dysphonic speech disorders by employing deep learning algorithms. PD is challenging to diagnose early on in the clinical presentation. To address the issue in machine learning methods, this paper proposes a neural network model by processing speech signals to classify PD using the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository dataset. Initially, a pre-loss reduction module is created by using pre-sampling to make the dataset balanced by reducing the dimensionality and maintaining the size of the space without influencing the learning process for data preparation. The relevant features are derived using a novel multi-agent salp swarm (MASS) algorithm, and a novel Parkinson classification neural network (PCNN) is proposed to classify Parkinson's patients with high accuracy employing these derived features. The result shows that the models that use MASS-PCNN produce higher classification accuracy of 99.1%, precision of 97.8%, recall of 94.7% and F1-score of 0.995 when paralleled to the existing models. As an outcome, the suggested model will perform superior to common convolutional neural networks.",

These diseases are categorized into various types like trauma, seizures, tumors, infection, and stroke. Parkinson's is a type of neurological disorder that creates unintentional activities, such like shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. In this work, the Parkinson's patient data have been classified using an ensemble machine learning approach. The data is taken from the UCI machine learning repository that consists of 252 samples. For the classification purpose, a deep stacked ensemble classification model is used, that consist of four base classifiers as deep neural network (DNN). The output of the base classifier is again considered as the input to the Meta classifier. The performance is then verified with two different types of Meta classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting. Again the accuracy of the gradient boosting Meta classifier is compared with variation of learning rate. From the result, it is observed that 98.21% classification accuracy is achieved using the modified gradient boosting Meta classifier with the stacked model.",

The following work delves into the domain of classiﬁcation models for Parkinson's disease through speech recordings using machine learning (ML). Diverse datasets were explored including (1) the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech; (2) Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London; (3) Synthetic Vowels of Speakers with Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism; and (4) Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls. Two types of feature extraction are used, incorporating traditional acoustic features (interpretable) and embeddings extracted using pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (noninterpretable): (1) TRILLsson; (2) Wav2Vec 2.0; (3) HuBERT. For the training algorithms, a myriad of methods were used, from simple logistic regression to XGBoost. The two types of features adopted displayed robustness, as the use of interpretable features reached up to 95% accuracy, while non-interpretable embeddings had a top-performing accuracy of 99%, surpassing the state-of-the-art.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a multi-faceted disease affecting the brain. The enormity of its recent rise is quite alarming. This calls for intense research to diagnose early to hasten the progress of diagnosis. Voice distortion is considered an early precursor for Parkinson's disease. Though several studies in Machine Learning using voice parameters have provided useful information, none of them have been successful in evolving an efficient and generalized model to detect it. Deep Learning techniques were applied to improve the performance of the model but its major limitation was the size of the dataset. Hence, a need arose to extend the dataset using an appropriate data augmentation method. At this juncture, the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) proved to be a useful technique because of its innate feature for generating synthetic data from input noise. The RNN-LSTM classifier could achieve a training accuracy of 87.32%, testing accuracy of 86.3%, training precision of 87.92 %, and testing precision of 89.94%. The results of the experimental study are compared with other state-of-the-art methods. This technique succeeded in reducing the problem of over-fitting and could elevate the performance of the RNN-LSTM classifier in the prediction of Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has long been an important task in medical intelligence. Recognition methods based on speech signals show great potential in Parkinson's disease diagnosis. In this paper, based on an efficient machine learning method for Parkinson's disease detection, we take the use of test data incorporates an efficient Secure Two-Party Computing (S2PC) protocol to protect the privacy of patients. We present two key components, the secure use of data and a local classification methodology, including the description of class boundaries. We conducted experiments on two datasets to validate our proposed method, and the results show well data security protection ability compared to some more sophisticated methods. And the performance of Local Classification on Class Boundary(LCCB) and Hyperplane K-Nearest Neighbor(HKNN) is significantly better than that of both Support Vector Machines(SVM) and Random Forest(RF). When the number of selected features is from 400 to 500, HKNN and LCCB are roughly equal where the accuracy of HKNN is 95.2%, and LCCB has the rate of 94.7%. Then we use Multi-Cluster Feature Selection(MCFS) to analyze and select the important features from D2 dataset. It shows that even if only two features are selected, the boundaries of the two categories are also clear and easy to distinguish.",

Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving the quality of life for PD patients. This study aims to enhance early PD diagnosis and improve patient outcomes using a novel approach. We proposed a TabNet model to classify patients with PD based on voice recordings and other features. TabNet is a neural network architecture designed specifically for tabular data. We compared its performance with support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), and decision trees (DTs). The TabNet model outperformed these methods, achieving an F1 Score of 83.03%. This demonstrates the model's potential for more accurate PD diagnosis, which could lead to better patient management and treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive longterm degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The symptoms usually develop slowly, starting with symptoms in the motor system and potentially evolving into non-motor symptoms as the disease worsens. It is estimated that 90% of patients with Parkinson's end up having speech disorders. The following work delves into the domain of classiﬁcation models for Parkinson's disease through speech recordings using machine learning (ML). Diverse datasets were explored including (1) the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech; (2) Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London; (3) Synthetic Vowels of Speakers with Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism; and (4) Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls. Two types of feature extraction are used, incorporating traditional acoustic features (interpretable) and embeddings extracted using pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (noninterpretable): (1) TRILLsson; (2) Wav2Vec 2.0; (3) HuBERT. For the training algorithms, a myriad of methods were used, from simple logistic regression to XGBoost. The two types of features adopted displayed robustness, as the use of interpretable features reached up to 95% accuracy, while non-interpretable embeddings had a top-performing accuracy of 99%, surpassing the state-of-the-art.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by a disruption in the chemical products that enables the communication between brain cells. The brain's dopamine cells are responsible for movement control, adaptability, and fluidity. Parkinson's motor symptoms manifest when 60-80% of these cells are damaged due to insufficient dopamine. Researchers are working to find a way to identify the non-motor symptoms that manifest early detection in the disease to stop the disease's progression because it is believed that the disease starts many years before the motor symptoms. This research presents Parkinson's disease diagnosis based on deep learning. Processes for feature selection and classification encompass the suggested diagnosis technique. The proposed model searches for the best subset of characteristics using the Improved Glowworm Swarm Optimization (IGSO) algorithm. Radial Basis Functions Networks (RBFN) classifiers evaluate the chosen features. The suggested model is tested using datasets from Parkinson's Handwriting samples and Parkinson's Speech and voice with various sound recordings. With an accuracy of about 95.78%, the suggested algorithm forecasts Parkinson's disease using the VoicePD dataset more precisely.",

A variety of efforts are underway to address these issues and improve diagnostic precision in Parkinson's disease. This paper employs well-known machine-learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy. A variety of individual and ensemble AI models have been proposed, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Stacking, and Bagging Ensemble classifiers. Three scenarios are applied to two standard benchmark datasets. The best performance is achieved when the Stacking Ensemble classifier is utilized, where the Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting are engaged for extracting features and Logistic Regression for classifying Parkinson's disease. The Stacking Ensemble classifier reaches 94.87% accuracy and 90.00% AUC for the first dataset, while for the second dataset, 96.18% accuracy and 96.27% AUC are recorded. The final results demonstrate the importance of the suggested framework, which can help to improve the overall diagnosis outcomes.",

During analysis, some abnormalities are considered as important symptoms to analyze the disease. Hence, this research introduced the proposed chronological smart sunflower optimization Algorithm (CSSFOA) for classifying the PD from voice data and voice signal samples. For voice signal, the input signals are pre-processed by the Gaussian filter, and then the significant features are extracted from it. The selection of optimal features is done by the chronological smart flower optimization Algorithm (CSFOA). The proposed CSFOA-based feature selection method considered the features by the Bray-Curtis distance. The PD classification is done by the ZF-Net which is trained by proposed CSSFOA to increase the performance of classification. The experimental result reveals that the proposed CSSFOA_ZF-Net algorithm got a better testing accuracy of 0.945, a sensitivity of 0.919, and a specificity of 0.957.",

  "abstract": "Automatic voice pathology detection enables objective assessment of pathologies that affect the voice production mechanism. Detection systems have been developed using the traditional pipeline approach (consisting of the feature extraction part and the detection part) and using the modern deep learning -based end-to-end approach. Due to the lack of vast amounts of training data in the study area of pathological voice, the former approach is still a valid choice. In the existing detection systems based on the traditional pipeline approach, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features can be regarded as the defacto standard feature set. In this study, automatic voice pathology detection is investigated by comparing the performance of various MFCC variants derived by considering two factors: the input and the filterbank in the cepstrum computation. For the first factor, three inputs (the voice signal, the glottal source and the vocal tract) are compared. The glottal source and the vocal tract are estimated using the quasi-closed phase glottal inverse filtering method. For the second factor, the mel-frequency and linear-frequency filterbanks are compared. Experiments were conducted separately using six databases consisting of voices produced by speakers suffering from one of four disorders (dysphonia, Parkinson's disease, laryngitis, or heart failure) and by healthy speakers. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier. The results show that by combining mel- and linear-frequency cepstral coefficients derived from the glottal source and vocal tract, better overall detection accuracy was obtained compared to the defacto MFCC features derived from the voice signal. Furthermore, this combination provided comparable or better performance than four existing cepstral feature extraction techniques in clean and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has affected millions of people worldwide and is more prevalent in people, over the age of 50. Even today, with many technologies and advancements, early detection of this disease remains a challenge. This necessitates a need for the machine learning-based automatic approaches that help clinicians to detect this disease accurately in its early stage. Thus, the focus of this research paper is to provide an insightful survey and compare the existing computational intelligence techniques used for PD detection. To save time and increase treatment efficiency, classification has found its place in PD detection. The existing knowledge review indicates that many classification algorithms have been used to achieve better results, but the problem is to identify the most efficient classifier for PD detection. The challenge in identifying the most appropriate classification algorithm lies in their application on local dataset. Thus, in this paper three types of classifiers, namely, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and K-nearest neighbor have been discussed on the benchmark (voice) dataset to compare and to know which of these classifiers is the most efficient and accurate for PD classification. The Voice input dataset for these classifiers has been obtained from UCI machine learning repository. ANN with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was found to be the best classifier, having highest classification accuracy (95.89%). Moreover, we compared our results with those obtained by Resul Das [“A comparison of multiple classification methods for diagnosis of Parkinson Disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnostics includes numerous analyses related to the neurological, physical, and psychical status of the patient. Medical teams analyze multiple symptoms and patient history considering verified genetic influences. The proposed method investigates the voice symptoms of this disease. The voice files are processed, and the feature extraction is conducted. Several machine learning techniques are used to recognize Parkinson's and healthy patients. This study focuses on examining PD diagnosis through voice data features. A new multi-agent feature filter (MAFT) algorithm is proposed to select the best features from the voice dataset. The MAFT algorithm is designed to select a set of features to improve the overall performance of prediction models and prevent over-fitting possibly due to extreme reduction to the features. Moreover, this algorithm aims to reduce the complexity of the prediction, accelerate the training phase, and build a robust training model. Ten different machine learning methods are then integrated with the MAFT algorithm to form a powerful voice-based PD diagnosis model. Recorded test results of the PD prediction model using the actual and filtered features yielded 86.38% and 86.67% accuracies on average, respectively. With the aid of the MAFT feature selection, the test results are improved by 3.2% considering the hybrid model (HM) and 3.1% considering the Naive Bayesian and random forest. Subsequently, an HM, which comprises a binary convolutional neural network and three feature selection algorithms (namely, genetic algorithm, Adam optimizer, and mini-batch gradient descent), is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of the PD. The results reveal that PD achieves an overall accuracy of 93.7%. The HM is integrated with the MAFT, and the combination realizes an overall accuracy of 96.9%. These results demonstrate that the combination of the MAFT algorithm and the HM model significantly enhances the PD diagnosis outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Voice acoustic analysis can be a valuable and objective tool supporting the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases, especially in times of distant medical examination during the pandemic. The article compares the application of selected signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms for the taxonomy of acquired speech signals representing the vowel a with prolonged phonation in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects. The study was conducted using three different feature engineering techniques for the generation of speech signal features as well as the deep learning approach based on the processing of images involving spectrograms of different time and frequency resolutions. The research utilized real recordings acquired in the Department of Neurology at the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. The discriminatory ability of feature vectors was evaluated using the SVM technique. The spectrograms were processed by the popular AlexNet convolutional neural network adopted to the binary classification task according to the strategy of transfer learning. The results of numerical experiments have shown different efficiencies of the examined approaches; however, the sensitivity of the best test based on the selected features proposed with respect to biological grounds of voice articulation reached the value of 97% with the specificity no worse than 93%. The results could be further slightly improved thanks to the combination of the selected deep learning and feature engineering algorithms in one stacked ensemble model.",

  "abstract": "Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease exhibit speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurogenerative disease that affects the nervous system. There is no permanent cure for this disease, so, its early diagnosis is important to improve the quality of living of Parkinson patients. The distortion of the voice is one of the ﬁrst symptoms to appear in Parkinson patients. Therefore, comparison and classiﬁcation plays an important role. In this paper, a comparison of various classiﬁcation techniques is done to show the potential of each classiﬁer. The various classiﬁcation techniques include SVM (Linear, RBF, Polynomial), DT, RF, LR, KNN, NB, MLP, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Three different types of feature selection techniques are also explored to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset without affecting the accuracy much. The three different feature selection techniques include mRMR, GA, and PCA. The potential of voice features in classiﬁcation process is also shown.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common and serious neurological diseases. Impairments in voice have been reported to be the early biomarkers of the disease. Hence, development of PD diagnostic tool will help early diagnosis of the disease. Additionally, intelligent system developed for binary classification of PD and healthy controls can also be exploited in future as an instrument for prodromal diagnosis. Notably, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) represent a good model as they develop PD with a high probability. It has been shown that slight speech and voice impairment may be a sensitive marker of preclinical PD. In this study, we propose PD detection by extracting cepstral features from the voice signals collected from people with PD and healthy subjects. To classify the extracted features, we propose to use dimensionality reduction through linear discriminant analysis and classification through support vector machine. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also developed ten different machine learning models. It was observed that the proposed method yield area under the curve (AUC) of 88%, sensitivity of 73.33%, and specificity of 84%. Moreover, the proposed intelligent system was simulated using publicly available multiple types of voice database. Additionally, the data were collected from patients under on-state. The obtained results on the public database are promising compared to the previously published work.",

  "abstract": "Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease exhibit speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most widespread diseases that, primarily, affects the motor system of the neural central system. In fact, PD is characterized by tremors, stiffness of the muscles, imprecise gait movements, and vocal impairment. An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is usually based on many neurological, psychological, and physical investigations despite the fact that its main symptoms cannot be easily decorrelated from other diseases. As such, many automatic diagnostic support systems based on Machine Learning approaches have been recently employed to assist the PD patients' assessment. In the current paper, a comparative analysis was performed on machine learning (ML) techniques for PD identification based on voice disorders analysis. These ML methods included the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms. In addition, two feature selection techniques; mRMR and ReliefF; are used to further improve the performance of the proposed classifiers. The efficiency of the developed model has been evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC metrics, and it is higher than existing approaches. The simulation results show that the KNN algorithm yielded the best classifier performance in term of accuracy and reached an AUC of 98.26%.",

  "abstract": "Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease exhibit speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

  "abstract": "Developing automatic methods to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) from speech has attracted increasing interest as these techniques can potentially be used in telemonitoring health applications. This article studies the utilization of voice source information in the detection of PD using two classifier architectures: traditional pipeline approach and end-to-end approach. The former consists of feature extraction and classifier stages. In feature extraction, the baseline acoustic features-consisting of articulation, phonation, and prosody features-were computed and voice source information was extracted using glottal features that were estimated by iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF) and quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering methods. Support vector machine classifiers were developed utilizing the baseline and glottal features extracted from every speech utterance and the corresponding healthy/PD labels. The end-to-end approach uses deep learning models which were trained using both raw speech waveforms and raw voice source waveforms. In the latter, two glottal inverse filtering methods (IAIF and QCP) and zero frequency filtering method were utilized. The deep learning architecture consists of a combination of convolutional layers followed by a multilayer perceptron. Experiments were performed using PC-GITA speech database. From the traditional pipeline systems, the highest classification accuracy (67.93%) was given by combination of baseline and QCP-based glottal features. From the end-to-end-systems, the highest accuracy (68.56%) was given by the system trained using QCP-based glottal flow signals. Even though classification accuracies were modest for all systems, the study is encouraging as the extraction of voice source information was found to be most effective in both approaches.",

There is no permanent cure for this disease, so, its early diagnosis is important to improve the quality of living of Parkinson patients. The distortion of the voice is one of the ﬁrst symptoms to appear in Parkinson patients. Therefore, comparison and classiﬁcation plays an important role. In this paper, a comparison of various classiﬁcation techniques is done to show the potential of each classiﬁer. The various classiﬁcation techniques include SVM (Linear, RBF, Polynomial), DT, RF, LR, KNN, NB, MLP, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Three different types of feature selection techniques are also explored to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset without affecting the accuracy much. The three different feature selection techniques include mRMR, GA, and PCA. The potential of voice features in classiﬁcation process is also shown.",

The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aging neurological disease deficiencies dopamine and occupies the second position among the neurological disease after the Alzheimer's in the world. The identification of PD in the early stage is extremely advanced and expensive. Many researchers investigated on PD in divergent ways and different approaches to identifying the PD in the early stage with low cost. One of the effective approaches such as PD voice analysis is an important topic in the current decade. In this paper, a novel probabilistic neural network-based approach is proposed for analyzing the PD. The major objective of this paper is to develop a highly accurate probabilistic neural network-based intelligent approach for the identification and classification of PD diseases. The inputs are considered as 1200 sound records as vowel vocalizations /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ in different timings (morning, mid-day, and night) of the day from 62 PD and 51 non-PD individuals. From the experimental analysis, it is evident that the performance of the dataset with PNN is increased proportionally to the incremental neurons in the hidden layer of PNN up to seven and it is found 100% accuracy with minimum time and gradient values. The projected PNN model with seven hidden layer neurons is a very powerful tool for predicting the PD in early detections with minimum cost. Comparative analysis with other standard machine learning approaches is evident towards the superiority of the proposed PNN model performance for successful identification of PD through voice analysis.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a kind of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. The disruption of brain cells that create dopamine, a chemical that allows brain cells to connect with one another, causes Parkinson's disease. Control, adaptability, and rapidity of movement are all controlled by dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Researchers have been investigating for techniques to identify non-motor symptoms that show early in the disease as soon as possible, slowing the disease's progression. A machine learning-based detection of Parkinson's disease is proposed in this research. Feature selection and classiﬁcation techniques are used in the proposed detection technique. Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) Classiﬁer have been used for the feature selection process. Four classiﬁcation algorithms are considered to detect Parkinson disease which are gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, bagging and Extra Tree Classiﬁer. Bagging with recursive feature elimination was found to outperform the other methods. The lowest number of voice characteristics for the diagnosis in Parkinson attained 82.35% accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most destructive diseases of the nervous system, affecting sound faster and more than any other subsystem of the body. Over the past decade, researchers have studied Parkinson's disease by analyzing audio signals. It is a low-cost method that eliminates the need for the patient to be physically present at the clinic. By recording the sound signal from the pronunciation of the words and then extracting the appropriate features from them, it is possible to identify the disturbance in the sound movements of the person with Parkinson's. Therefore, the ability to diagnose the disease before other clinical symptoms will be available. This paper examines the disability caused by Parkinson's voice disorder and extracts parameters from the audio signal that well illustrate the disabilities in the voice. The proposed method uses a sparse representation algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the feature. At this stage, the best features are extracted from the person's voice and appearance. Then, the resulting properties are sent as input to the sparse code classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed method for approximate message passing (AMP) classifiers is 99.11%. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that it has reduced storage space, in addition to increasing the efficiency of detection compared to the other methods.",

  "abstract": "The study of the inﬂuence of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on vocal signals has received much attention over the last decades. Increasing interest has been devoted to articulation and acoustic characterization of different phonemes. Method: In this study we propose the analysis of the Transition Regions (TR) of speciﬁc phonetic groups to model the loss of motor control and the difﬁculty to start/stop movements, typical of PD patients. For this purpose, we extracted 60 features from pre-processed vocal signals and used them as input to several machine learning models. We employed two data sets, containing samples from Italian native speakers, for training and testing. The ﬁrst dataset - 28 PD patients and 22 Healthy Control (HC) - included recordings in optimal conditions, while in the second one - 26 PD patients and 18 HC - signals were collected at home, using non-professional microphones. Results: We optimized two support vector machine models for the application in controlled noise conditions and home environments, achieving 98% ± 1.1 and 88% ± 2.8 accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. Conclusion: This study conﬁrms the high capability of the TRs to discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls, and the feasibility of automatic PD assessment using voice recordings. Moreover, the promising performance of the implemented model discloses the option of voice processing using low-cost devices and domestic recordings, possibly self-managed by the patients themselves.",

  "abstract": "Speech disorder is one of the most dominant symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The speaking ability deteriorates as the disease progresses. However, regular screening and monitoring can improve the quality of living. Most of the patients in developing countries cannot access healthcare services due to a lack of facilities and costs. So a Cloud-based Smartphone application can be a cost-effective solution to this problem. This study aims to design and develop a tool for screening Parkinson's disease in real-time based on speech analysis. We adopted a machine learning-based approach for screening Parkinson's disease in real-time. This study applied several machine learning algorithms and found that the k-nearest neighbor algorithm performed better. Our model achieved 81.58% sensitivity, with 85.11% specificity in discriminating PD patients from healthy individuals using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. We tested our system in real-time and recruited 9 PD patients and 9 Healthy individuals, and recorded their voices for 10 seconds using our smartphone application. In real-time, we achieved 77.78% sensitivity with 33.33% specificity. Our study also demonstrated that Smartphone-based mobile applications could be a cost-effective solution for screening Parkinson's disease in real-time.",

  "abstract": "Detection of voice changes in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients would make it possible for early detection and intervention before the onset of disabling physical symptoms. This study explores static and dynamic speech features relating to PD detection. A comparative analysis of the articulation transition characteristics shows that the number of articulation transitions and the trend of the fundamental frequency curve are significantly different between HC speakers and PD patients. Motivated by this observation, we propose to apply Bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) model to capture time-series dynamic features of a speech signal for detecting PD. The dynamic speech features are measured based on computing the energy content in the transition from unvoiced to voiced segments (onset), and in the transition from voiced to unvoiced segments (offset). Under the two evaluation methods of 10-fold cross validation (CV) and splitting the dataset without samples overlap of one individual, the experimental results show that the proposed method remarkably improves the accuracy of PD detection over traditional machine learning models using static features.",

  "abstract": "The development of a cloud-based Parkinson's disease identification system is identified as one of the most challenging issues for predictive telediagnosis and telemonitoring in the emerging smart healthcare applications. The traditional way of Parkinson's disease identification by clinical parameters is more costly and uncomfortable for rural people to avail the testing and diagnosis from the remote place. So, the cloud-assisted Parkinson's disease identification system (CAPDIS) is proposed based on non-clinical parameters with patient-centric and cost-effective features for helping the poor patients living in rural as well as urban areas. In addition, the proposed system diagnoses the remote patient by examining the symptoms like dysphonia which is identified as the most severe neurodegenerative disorder in the world. Further, the proposed system has experimented with the benchmark voice dataset collected from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository. It shows that the proposed CAPDIS system with adaptive linear kernel support vector machines (k-SVM) classifier has significant improvements on detection accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and Matthews's correlation coefficient scores while comparing to the existing classifiers. Therefore, the proposed adaptive linear k-SVM classifiers provide 10% improvements on prediction accuracy and F1-Score over the existing polynomial, radial basis, and sigmoidal-based k-SVM classifiers.",

Speech impairment is one of the earliest PD symptoms, and may be used for an automatic assessment to support the diagnosis and the evaluation of the disease severity, in the two biological sexes (male and female). This study investigates the processing of voice signals for measuring the incidence of Parkinson's disease in women and men. The approach evaluates the use of several extracted features and two learning techniques Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify data obtained from four databases. Each database contains different data to each other and in a different language. The audio tasks were recorded using six different microphone.

  "abstract": "Speech impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been extensively studied. Our understanding of speech in people who are at an increased risk of developing PD is, however, rather limited. It is known that isolated Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is associated with a high risk of developing PD. The aim of this study is to investigate smartphone speech testing to: (1) distinguish participants with RBD from controls and PD, and (2) predict a range of self- or researcher-administered clinical scores that quantify participants' motor symptoms, cognition, daytime sleepiness, depression, and the overall state of health. The rationale of our analyses is to test an initial hypothesis that speech can be used to detect and quantify the symptoms associated with RBD and PD. We analyzed 4242 smartphone voice recordings collected in clinic and at home from 92 Controls, 112 RBD and 335 PD participants. We used acoustic signal analysis and machine learning, employing 337 features that quantify different properties of speech impairment. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, we were able to distinguish RBD from controls (sensitivity 60.7%, specificity 69.6%) and RBD from PD participants (sensitivity 74.9%, specificity 73.2%), and predict clinical assessments with clinically useful accuracy. These promising findings warrant further investigation in using speech as a digital biomarker for PD and RBD to facilitate intervention in the early and prodromal stages of PD.",

  "abstract": "Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease exhibit speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

Detection systems have been developed using the traditional pipeline approach (consisting of the feature extraction part and the detection part) and using the modern deep learning -based end-to-end approach.

In the existing detection systems based on the traditional pipeline approach, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features can be regarded as the defacto standard feature set. In this study, automatic voice pathology detection is investigated by comparing the performance of various MFCC variants derived by considering two factors: the input and the filterbank in the cepstrum computation. For the first factor, three inputs (the voice signal, the glottal source and the vocal tract) are compared. The glottal source and the vocal tract are estimated using the quasi-closed phase glottal inverse filtering method. For the second factor, the mel-frequency and linear-frequency filterbanks are compared. Experiments were conducted separately using six databases consisting of voices produced by speakers suffering from one of four disorders (dysphonia, Parkinson's disease, laryngitis, or heart failure) and by healthy speakers. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier. The results show that by combining mel- and linear-frequency cepstral coefficients derived from the glottal source and vocal tract, better overall detection accuracy was obtained compared to the defacto MFCC features derived from the voice signal. Furthermore, this combination provided comparable or better performance than four existing cepstral feature extraction techniques in clean and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, and patients need periodic monitoring which is difﬁcult for them and costs a lot. In recent years, there has been much research about the link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and speech impairment in order to provide an early diagnosis of the disease and create a system for remote monitoring of patients as well. Many studies have used signal and speech processing techniques to convert acoustic signals into vectors of features which are then mapped into different machine learning algorithms. The results obtained in PD telemedicine studies have shown that the choice of feature extraction techniques and classiﬁcation algorithms directly inﬂuence the accuracy and reliability of the proposed system. This article provides a system to assess the speech disorders in the context of PD using features extracted from three domains (time/frequency, cepstral, and wavelet domain) and machine learning tools. Our goal is to assess the ability of each individual to distinguish those with Parkinson's disease from healthy people. The results suggest that cepstral domain gives the most reliable parametrization comparable to time/frequency and wavelet domain with a high accuracy using Support Vector Machine classiﬁer.",

  "abstract": "Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease exhibit speech impairments that affect their communication capabilities. The automatic assessment of the speech of the patients allows to develop computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and to evaluate the disease severity, which helps clinicians to make timely decisions about the treatment of the patients. This paper extends our previous studies about methods to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases from speech. The proposed approach considers convolutional neural networks trained with time frequency representations and a transfer learning strategy to classify different speech impairments in patients that are native of different languages. The transfer learning schemes aim to improve the accuracy of the models when the weights of a neural network are initialized with utterances from a different corpus than the one used for the test set. The proposed methodology is evaluated with speech data from Parkinson's disease patients, who are Spanish, German, and Czech native speakers, Huntington's disease patients, who are Czech native speakers, and English native speakers affected by laryngeal impairments. We performed experiments in two scenarios: (1) transfer learning among languages, where a base model is transferred to classify patients with the same disease, but who speak a different language, and (2) transfer learning among diseases, where the base model is transferred to a corpus from patients with a different disease. The results suggest that the transfer learning schemes improve the accuracy in the target corpus only when the base model is accurate enough to transfer the knowledge to the target corpus. This behavior is observed in different scenarios of both transfer learning among languages and diseases.",

  "abstract": "In the medical field, the recent advancement in technologies promotes the identification of diseases in their early stages for reducing the disease severity, and the diseases are detected automatically with the classifiers availing in the medical data. The ease of data availability contributes several information to doctors regarding diseases. Accordingly, the present research develops a spa-hunt optimizer-based Deep CNN for predicting disease in the healthcare system. The significance of the present research relies on the growth of a novel classifier for predicting the disease at an earlier stage, which is referred to as an optimized deep CNN (DCNN) classifier, where the hyperparameters of the research will be tuned optimally with the proposed Spa-Hunt optimizer that is developed by combining the optimization for an accurate result with less computational time. Finally, the collected data from the patients will be secured in blockchain after predicting the concerned disease. The accuracy of the developed system of prediction is 92.308% with the Parkinson's database, and 99.268%, with the heart disease database regarding the training percentage. Hence, the developed approach provides efficient performance in detecting disease with secured data and serves as an efficient tool in the field of healthcare for disease detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, with a sharp increase predicted. Classifying and predicting PD at an early stage is crucial. Application of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a signiﬁcant factor in the diagnosis of various disorders. Based on patient data, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can automatically predict PD. This research aims to develop an automated approach for early PD prediction based on vocal symptoms and AI techniques. To forecast PD, speciﬁc AI models have been implemented. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB or XGBoost), artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and ridge classiﬁer with cross-validation (RidgeCV) were among the AI models used. The dataset was subjected to various data preprocessing approaches, such as Min-Max scaling and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Sensitivity, accuracy, F1-score, precision, speciﬁcity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were among the evaluation measures used to assess the effectiveness of the implemented AI system. The results demonstrated that, with 98% accuracy, 97% precision, 100% sensitivity, 98% F1-score, 97% speciﬁcity, and 100% AUC, the XGB model utilizing SMOTE approach achieved the best results. With the proposed approach, patients can forecast their PD early. The proposed work contributes signiﬁcantly to the ﬁeld of neurodegenerative disease research by demonstrating the effectiveness of AI techniques in early PD prediction, which can have profound implications for patient care and treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Early detection and characterization are crucial for treating and managing Parkinson's disease (PD). The increasing prevalence of PD and its significant impact on the motor neurons of the brain impose a substantial burden on the healthcare system. Early-stage detection is vital for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This study introduces an ensemble boosting machine, termed PD_EBM, for the detection of PD. PD_EBM leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms and a hybrid feature selection approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy. While ML has shown promise in medical applications for PD detection, the interpretability of these models remains a significant challenge. Explainable machine learning (XML) addresses this by providing transparency and clarity in model predictions. Techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have become popular for interpreting these models. Our experiment used a dataset of 195 clinical records of PD patients from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository. Comprehensive data preparation included encoding categorical features, imputing missing values, removing outliers, addressing data imbalance, scaling data, selecting relevant features, and so on. We propose a hybrid boosting framework that focuses on the most important features for prediction. Our boosting model employs a Decision Tree (DT) classifier with AdaBoost, followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) optimizer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.44%, outperforming other boosting models.",

It is difficult to precisely diagnose PD, especially in its early stages, because the signs and symptoms can resemble those of other medical conditions or normal age-related changes. This paper proposes a hybrid model combining Particle Swarm Optimization with Extreme Learning Machine (PSO-ELM) for PD diagnosis. This paper employs three feature ranking algorithms, namely ReliefF, minimum Redundancy Maximum relevance (mRMR), and Fisher, on six publicly available PD datasets. Various top-ranked feature subsets are created to identify the most discriminative features and enhance the performance of the proposed hybrid PSO-ELM model for all datasets. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed model is compared with basic models, namely ELM, SVM, RF, and the previous works. The results show that the proposed PSO-ELM model achieved the highest average accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 100% each over the 3-fold cross-validation with a minimum number of features for all the six datasets. Therefore, the PSO-ELM model may be used as a highly accurate and efficient tool for PD diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor impairments and tremors, also presents early-stage vocal abnormalities that hold diagnostic potential. Leveraging voice analysis and classification techniques, numerous studies explore the feasibility of early PD detection through automated systems. While several databases offer acoustic features for this purpose, their effectiveness largely depends on the classification methodology employed. This study aims to refine PD detection systems by introducing customized weighting to acoustic features, adjusting their significance based on their correlation with the disease and the classification algorithm utilized. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed for this purpose, with the Oxford PD dataset serving as the source data for training and validation. Performance evaluation encompasses four classification algorithms: support vector machine, Gradient Boosting (GB), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes. A 5-fold cross-validation technique was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method for PD detection. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance regardless of the classifier used, demonstrating its generalization capability. The KNN classifier surpasses state-of-the-art results, achieving an accuracy of 97.44% and a sensitivity of 98.02%.",

  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the potential of voice analysis—speciﬁcally sustained vowel phonation—as a non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic method for early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) using machine learning techniques. Methods: A publicly available dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository, comprising 252 voice recordings (188 from PD patients and 64 from healthy individuals), was analyzed. Machine learning classiﬁers, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs), were trained and tested on the dataset. Model evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Kernel density estimation was applied to visualize and interpret classiﬁer performance. Results: Among the classiﬁers, KNN demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 98.52% and a mean accuracy of 97.33%. ANN and AdaBoost achieved mean accuracies of 93.15% and 91.77%, respectively. All models performed well across standard evaluation metrics, indicating strong discriminative ability for detecting PD from voice data. Conclusion: The study conﬁrms the feasibility of using sustained vowel phonation and machine learning for early PD diagnosis. The KNN classiﬁer, in particular, shows excellent diagnostic accuracy. These ﬁndings support the integration of voice-based machine learning tools into clinical workﬂows, potentially enhancing early detection and management of PD.",

  "abstract": "Achieving high accuracy, efficiency and robustness remains a primary challenge in Parkinson's disease (PD) detection, as existing methods often struggle with these aspects. Additionally, data imbalance in medical datasets further limits the reliability of current models. Given the critical role of precise PD classification in medical diagnostics, this study proposes a novel framework to enhance detection accuracy. The proposed framework leverages a strong categorical boosting (CatBoost) algorithm optimized using Grid Search Optimization (GSO). The analysis was conducted on a PD dataset derived from speech recording signals. To address the data imbalance, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied as a pre-processing step to improve the robustness and reliability of the model. The framework is tested with several feature subsets, as well as their combined set. In addition, RReliefF feature selection was also applied to identify the optimal subset of features. For the selected feature subset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 0.9261, precision of 0.9633, sensitivity of 0.9375, F1-score of 0.9502, specificity of 0.8947, AUC of 0.9549 and a testing time of 0.012s. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in accurately diagnosing PD, thereby providing a reliable and efficient tool for future medical diagnostics.",

  "abstract": "Accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) through speech analysis holds great promise for early diagnosis and improved patient management. However, developing robust machine learning models is challenging due to the decentralized nature of medical data and the substantial heterogeneity in multilingual PD speech datasets. Conventional federated learning (FL) methods struggle in these heterogeneous, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) environments, where differences in data distributions arise from variations in language, speech content, recording conditions, medical measurement techniques, and dataset sizes. To address these challenges, we propose FedOcw, an optimized FL framework designed to enhance cross-lingual knowledge transfer and improve convergence stability. Through extensive multilingual experiments, we demonstrate that FedOcw consistently outperforms traditional FL models by achieving superior diagnostic accuracy while ensuring adaptive and equitable weight distribution across clients. These findings highlight FedOcw as an effective FL solution for privacy-preserving, speech-based PD detection across diverse linguistic and institutional settings.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that primarily affects motor function. Clinical challenges associated with this condition include accurately diagnosing patients in the early stages of the disease and predicting how the condition will progress. This project aims to enhance PD detection by integrating feature selection and classiﬁcation using supervised learning techniques. Two publicly available datasets—the speech and PD classiﬁcation datasets—are utilized to evaluate model performance across diverse features. The proposed work employs class balancing through the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the issue of class imbalance in this highly unbalanced dataset. Subsequently, the Relief algorithm is used for feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors. An ensemble of models is applied using the RF-XGBoost-KNN classiﬁers due to their superior accuracy compared to other classiﬁer combinations. The RF-XGBoost-KNN model stack achieved classiﬁcation accuracies of 94.56% and 93.53% for the PD speech dataset and Parkinson's Disease Classiﬁcation Dataset, respectively, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for early and accurate PD diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor control, leading to symptoms such as tremors and stiffness. Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment, but traditional methods are often time-consuming and expensive. This study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, using voice analysis to detect early signs of PD. We applied a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a dataset of 81 voice recordings. Acoustic features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), jitter, and shimmer were analyzed. The model achieved 91.11% accuracy, 92.50% recall, 89.84% precision, 91.13% F1 score, and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9125. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provided data explainability, identifying key features driving the PD diagnosis, thus enhancing AI interpretability and trustability. Furthermore, a probability-based scoring system was developed to enable PD patients and clinicians to track disease progression. This AI-driven approach offers a non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid tool for early PD detection, facilitating personalized treatment through vocal biomarkers.",

  "abstract": "Objective: With the increasing prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the development of PD-based acoustic recording databases, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using an ensemble-based machine learning (ML) approach to detect PD across diverse acoustic datasets. Methods: We utilized three publicly available PD speech datasets—MIU (Sakar), UEX (Carrón), and UCI (Little)—to build ML models incorporating a hybrid preprocessing framework. This framework includes a scaling phase (using RobustScaler), a sampling phase (employing random oversampling (ROS), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and random undersampling (RUS)), and an ML classiﬁer selection phase (featuring eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)). Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, we conducted SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify the most signiﬁcant PDrelated acoustic features. Results: The optimal combination of preprocessing and classiﬁcation techniques varied across datasets. However, the highest classiﬁcation performance was generally achieved using RobustScaler for scaling, a combination of ROS, SMOTE, and RUS for sampling, and XGBoost or AdaBoost for classiﬁcation. The best-performing model on the MIU dataset achieved accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.07%, and F1-score of 96.57%. The UEX and UCI datasets achieved perfect classiﬁcation with 100% accuracy, precision, and recall. SHAP analysis revealed that Mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients were consistently among the most inﬂuential PD-related acoustic features. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the feasibility of an ensemble-based approach for PD detection using acoustic recordings, highlighting the importance of dataset-speciﬁc preprocessing strategies. This study ranks impactful PD-related acoustic features, offering guidance for future voice-based PD screening tools.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. PD can be diagnosed at an early stage by analyzing patient datasets, such as speech and handwriting samples. In this paper, a modified version of the classical Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) is proposed with an application to detect early-stage PD through processing such datasets. The new model (MGWO-eP) aims to enhance the algorithm's exploration capability (e) and overcome local optima issues by adjusting a key parameter (P) that controls the search agents' positions. The MGWO-eP is then applied as a feature selection technique to predict PD in its early stages, using samples of speech and writing. The effectiveness of MGWO-eP is validated by benchmark optimization functions for achieving the global optimum. Then six popular machine learning classifiers are applied to three benchmark PD prediction datasets that include hand-writing and speech samples from people with and without PD, namely HandPD Spiral, HandPD Meander, and SpeechPD. The proposed model achieves best overall accuracies of 96.30% (with voting), 94.45% (with random forest), and 98.31% (with voting), outperforming GWO and particle swarm optimization algorithms as they get stuck with local optimal solutions. The results show that the proposed model is robust and can be used for early detection of PD in patients through analyzing datasets, such as their handwriting and speech to help the patients access treatments early in the disease, prolonging time spent with adequate symptom control and delaying years of disability/morbidity.",

  "abstract": "Objective: With the increasing prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the development of PD-based acoustic recording databases, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using an ensemble-based machine learning (ML) approach to detect PD across diverse acoustic datasets. Methods: We utilized three publicly available PD speech datasets—MIU (Sakar), UEX (Carrón), and UCI (Little)—to build ML algorithms incorporating a hybrid preprocessing framework. This framework includes a scaling phase (using Robustscaling), a imbalance_handling phase (employing random overimbalance_handling (ROS), synthetic minority overimbalance_handling technique (SMOTE), and random underimbalance_handling (RUS)), and an ML classiﬁer selection phase (featuring eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)). Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1_score metrics. Additionally, we conducted SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify the most signiﬁcant PDrelated acoustic features. Results: The optimal combination of preprocessing and classiﬁcation techniques varied across datasets. However, the highest classiﬁcation performance was generally achieved using Robustscaling for scaling, a combination of ROS, SMOTE, and RUS for imbalance_handling, and XGBoost or AdaBoost for classiﬁcation. The best-performing algorithm on the MIU dataset achieved accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.07%, and f1_score of 96.57%. The UEX and UCI datasets achieved perfect classiﬁcation with 100% accuracy, precision, and recall. SHAP analysis revealed that Mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients were consistently among the most inﬂuential PD-related acoustic features. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the feasibility of an ensemble-based approach for PD detection using acoustic recordings, highlighting the importance of dataset-speciﬁc preprocessing strategies. This study ranks impactful PD-related acoustic features, offering guidance for future voice-based PD screening tools.",

Early-stage detection is vital for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This study introduces an ensemble boosting machine, termed PD_EBM, for the detection of PD. PD_EBM leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms and a hybrid feature selection approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy. While ML has shown promise in medical applications for PD detection, the interpretability of these models remains a significant challenge. Explainable machine learning (XML) addresses this by providing transparency and clarity in model predictions. Techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have become popular for interpreting these models. Our experiment used a dataset of 195 clinical records of PD patients from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository. Comprehensive data preparation included encoding categorical features, imputing missing values, removing outliers, addressing data imbalance, scaling data, selecting relevant features, and so on. We propose a hybrid boosting framework that focuses on the most important features for prediction. Our boosting model employs a Decision Tree (DT) classifier with AdaBoost, followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) optimizer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.44%, outperforming other boosting models.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning approaches including deep learning models have shown promising performance in the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease. These approaches rely on different types of data with voice recordings being the most used due to the convenient and non-invasive nature of data acquisition. Our group has successfully developed a novel approach that uses convolutional neural network with transfer learning to analyze spectrogram images of the sustained vowel /a/ to identify people with Parkinson's disease. We tested this approach by collecting a dataset of voice recordings via analog telephone lines, which support limited bandwidth. The convolutional neural network with transfer learning approach showed superior performance against conventional machine learning methods that collapse measurements across time to generate feature vectors. This study builds upon our prior results and presents two novel contributions: First, we tested the performance of our approach on a larger voice dataset recorded using smartphones with wide bandwidth. Our results show comparable performance between two datasets generated using different recording platforms despite the differences in most important features resulting from the limited bandwidth of analog telephonic lines. Second, we compared the classification performance achieved using linear-scale and mel-scale spectrogram images and showed a small but statistically significant gain using mel-scale spectrograms.",

Clinical challenges associated with this condition include accurately diagnosing patients in the early stages of the disease and predicting how the condition will progress. This project aims to enhance PD detection by integrating feature selection and classiﬁcation using supervised learning techniques. Two publicly available datasets—the speech and PD classiﬁcation datasets—are utilized to evaluate model performance across diverse features. The proposed work employs class balancing through the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the issue of class imbalance in this highly unbalanced dataset. Subsequently, the Relief algorithm is used for feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors. An ensemble of models is applied using the RF-XGBoost-KNN classiﬁers due to their superior accuracy compared to other classiﬁer combinations. The RF-XGBoost-KNN model stack achieved classiﬁcation accuracies of 94.56% and 93.53% for the PD speech dataset and Parkinson's Disease Classiﬁcation Dataset, respectively, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for early and accurate PD diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts motor function and speech patterns. Early detection of PD through non-invasive methods, such as speech analysis, can improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model that uses speech recordings and acoustic features to predict PD. Methods: A dataset of speech recordings from individuals with and without PD was analyzed. The dataset includes features such as fundamental frequency (Fo), jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR), and non-linear dynamic complexity measures. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets. To address class imbalance, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied. Several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, were implemented and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) metrics. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to explain the models and evaluate feature contributions. Results: The analysis revealed that features related to speech instability, such as jitter, shimmer, and NHR, were highly predictive of PD. Non-linear metrics, including Recurrence Plot Dimension Entropy (RPDE) and Pitch Period Entropy (PPE), also made significant contributions to the model's predictive power. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved the highest performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.98, recall of 0.95, ensuring minimal false negatives. SHAp values highlighted the importance of fundamental frequency variation and harmonic-to-noise ratio in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals. Conclusion: The developed machine learning model accurately predicts Parkinson's disease using speech recordings, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms demonstrating superior performance. Key predictive features include jitter, shimmer, and non-linear dynamic complexity measures. This study provides a reliable, non-invasive tool for early PD detection and underscores the potential of speech analysis in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a reduction in dopamine levels in the brain. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This paper proposes an efficient machine learning model for PD detection using voice-based features, which offer a non-invasive, costeffective, and accessible alternative to complex imaging methods. To enhance classification performance and reduce computational complexity, we evaluate three feature selection algorithms — Chi-squared (χ 2), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) — and adopt an incremental feature selection approach, where each feature set increment is assessed across five classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To address dataset imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied. Among the evaluated approaches, the ANOVA algorithm yields the most optimal feature set, with the top 10 features enabling the Quadratic SVM to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.86%. The Quadratic SVM, optimized for minimal power consumption, is implemented on a Nexys A7 FPGA. This setup achieves a dynamic power consumption of just 23 mW and delivers a performance acceleration of 155x compared to equivalent computations on a 6th-generation Intel i5 processor. By combining a high-accuracy machine learning model with an energy-efficient FPGA implementation, our approach offers a powerful and portable solution for real-time PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning approaches including deep learning models have shown promising performance in the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease. These approaches rely on different types of data with voice recordings being the most used due to the convenient and non-invasive nature of data acquisition. Our group has successfully developed a novel approach that uses convolutional neural network with transfer learning to analyze spectrogram images of the sustained vowel /a/ to identify people with Parkinson's disease. We tested this approach by collecting a dataset of voice recordings via analog telephone lines, which support limited bandwidth. The convolutional neural network with transfer learning approach showed superior performance against conventional machine learning methods that collapse measurements across time to generate feature vectors. This study builds upon our prior results and presents two novel contributions: First, we tested the performance of our approach on a larger voice dataset recorded using smartphones with wide bandwidth. Our results show comparable performance between two datasets generated using different recording platforms despite the differences in most important features resulting from the limited bandwidth of analog telephonic lines. Second, we compared the classification performance achieved using linear-scale and mel-scale spectrogram images and showed a small but statistically significant gain using mel-scale spectrograms.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that affects approximately 10 million individuals globally and is ranked as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition after Alzheimer's disease. Vocal disorders can be identified in approximately 90% of PD patients in the early stages of the disease. In this study, 19 machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to a database of voice recordings of healthy individuals and individuals with PD obtained from a public repository. Different feature selection (FS) and hyperparameter optimization techniques were applied to all models for training, testing, and validation data. Among the ML algorithms, support vector machine with radial kernel, Naïve Bayes (NB), and Gaussian process classifier (GPC) yielded promising results when considering all features. Linear discriminant analysis, K neighbors classifier (KNN), extra trees classifier, GPC, and NB demonstrated excellent performance on the testing data after employing FS techniques. Decision tree classifier, KNN, and GPC emerged as the top performers when applied to the validation dataset. Our findings, derived from an extensive and chronological review of studies utilizing the same dataset, which surpass previous benchmarks, provide a comprehensive understanding of ML's application in voice analysis to support accurate clinical decision-making.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that gradually causes movement impairment and various symptoms. It is difficult to precisely diagnose PD, especially in its early stages, because the signs and symptoms can resemble those of other medical conditions or normal age-related changes. This paper proposes a hybrid model combining Particle Swarm Optimization with Extreme Learning Machine (PSO-ELM) for PD diagnosis. This paper employs three feature ranking algorithms, namely ReliefF, minimum Redundancy Maximum relevance (mRMR), and Fisher, on six publicly available PD datasets. Various top-ranked feature subsets are created to identify the most discriminative features and enhance the performance of the proposed hybrid PSO-ELM model for all datasets. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed model is compared with basic models, namely ELM, SVM, RF, and the previous works. The results show that the proposed PSO-ELM model achieved the highest average accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 100% each over the 3-fold cross-validation with a minimum number of features for all the six datasets. Therefore, the PSO-ELM model may be used as a highly accurate and efficient tool for PD diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that mainly affects people in old age. Abnormality in the speech signals has been reported as a biomarker to detect PD. This study explores the use of Hilbert spectrum (HS) based features to model voice impairments in people affected by PD. The instantaneous energy deviation cepstral coefficient (IEDCC) is proposed. Statistical analyses show that the proposed feature is an effective and relevant biomarker for PD detection and evaluation of the dysarthria level in speech affected by PD. The capability of the proposed features to differentiate between PD and healthy people is evaluated upon five sustained vowels and ten isolated words from the standard PC-GITA database. The average accuracy of the proposed approach ranges from 82 % to 90 % with vowels, whereas for words the average accuracy ranges between 80 % and 91 %. Besides PD detection, the dysarthria level is evaluated according to the m-FDA scale. Spearman's correlation coefficients () are computed between the estimated m-FDA values and the original scores. Correlations of up to 0.75 are obtained with vowel/o/, while 0.77 is the highest correlation obtained with the word/reina/. The developed models are further validated with a separate and independent dataset. The classification accuracy in these additional recordings ranges between 50 % and 80 % with vowels and from 50 % to 82 % with words. The promising results obtained on the additional test set indicate that the proposed method is suitable to perform the automatic detection of PD speakers in real-world conditions.",

  "abstract": " Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder often accompanied by impairment in articulation, phonation, prosody and fluency of speech. In fact, speech impairment is one of the earliest Parkinson's disease symptoms, and may be used for early diagnosis. We present an experimental study of identification of Parkinson's disease and assessment of disease progress from speech using Gaussian processes, which is further combined with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) for efficient feature selection. Hyperparameters of ARD covariance functions are learned for each individual feature; therefore, can be used for evaluation of their importance. In that way only a small subset of highly relevant acoustic features is selected, leading to models with better performance and lower complexity. The performance of the proposed method was assessed on two datasets: Parkinson's disease detection dataset, which contains a range of biomedical voice measurements obtained from 31 subjects, 23 of them suffering from Parkinson's disease and 8 healthy subjects; and Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset, containing biomedical voice measurements collected from 42 Parkinson's disease patients for estimation of the disease progress. Gaussian process classification with automatic relevance determination is able to successfully discriminate between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls with 96.92% accuracy, outperforming Support Vector Machines and decision tree ensembles (random forests, boosted and bagged decision trees). The usability of Gaussian processes is further confirmed in regression task for tracking the progress of the disease.",

  "abstract": "Recent research on Parkinson disease (PD) detection has shown that vocal disorders are linked to symptoms in 90% of the PD patients at early stages. Thus, there is an interest in applying vocal features to the computer-assisted diagnosis and remote monitoring of patients with PD at early stages. The contribution of this research is an increase of accuracy and a reduction of the number of selected vocal features in PD detection while using the newest and largest public dataset available. Whereas the number of features in this public dataset is 754, the number of selected features for classification ranges from 8 to 20 after using Wrappers feature subset selection. Four classifiers (k nearest neighbor, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine and random forest) are applied to vocal-based PD detection. The proposed approach shows an accuracy of 94.7%, sensitivity of 98.4%, specificity of 92.68% and precision of 97.22%. The best resulting accuracy is obtained by using a support vector machine and it is higher than the one, which was reported on the first work to use the same dataset. In addition, the corresponding computational complexity is further reduced by selecting no more than 20 features.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder prevalent in old age. Past studies have shown that speech can be used as an early marker for identification of PD. It affects a number of speech components such as phonation, speech intensity, articulation, and respiration, which alters the speech intelligibility. Speech feature extraction and classification always have been challenging tasks due to the existence of non-stationary and discontinuity in the speech signal. In this study, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based features are demonstrated to capture the speech characteristics. A new feature, intrinsic mode function cepstral coefficient (IMFCC) is proposed to efficiently represent the characteristics of Parkinson speech. The performances of proposed features are assessed with two different datasets: dataset-1 and dataset-2 each having 20 normal and 25 Parkinson affected peoples. From the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed intrinsic mode function cepstral coefficient feature provides superior classification accuracy in both datasets. There is a significant increase of 10-20% in accuracy compared to the standard acoustic and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder prevalent in old age. Past studies have shown that speech can be used as an early marker for identification of PD. It affects a number of speech components such as phonation, speech intensity, articulation, and respiration, which alters the speech intelligibility. Speech feature extraction and classification always have been challenging tasks due to the existence of non-stationary and discontinuity in the speech signal. In this study, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based features are demonstrated to capture the speech characteristics. A new feature, intrinsic mode function cepstral coefficient (IMFCC) is proposed to efficiently represent the characteristics of Parkinson speech. The performances of proposed features are assessed with two different datasets: dataset-1 and dataset-2 each having 20 normal and 25 Parkinson affected peoples. From the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed intrinsic mode function cepstral coefficient feature provides superior classification accuracy in both datasets. There is a significant increase of 10-20% in accuracy compared to the standard acoustic and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features.",

  "abstract": "In this study, a novel method to automatically detect Parkinson's disease (PD) using vowels is proposed. A combination of minimum average maximum (MAMa) tree and singular value decomposition (SVD) are used to extract the salient features from the voice signals. A novel feature signal is constructed from 3 levels of MAMa tree in the preprocessing phase. The SVD operator is applied to the constructed signal for feature extraction. Then 50 most distinctive features are selected using relief feature selection technique. Finally, k nearest neighborhood (KNN) with 10-fold cross validation is used for the classification. We have achieved the highest classification accuracy rate of 92.46% using vowels with KNN classifier. The dataset used consists of 3 vowels for each person. To obtain individual results, post processing step is performed and best result of 96.83% is obtained with KNN classifier. The proposed method is ready to be tested with huge database and can aid the neurologists in the diagnosis of PD using vowels.",

  "abstract": "Speech signals may contain different paralinguistic aspects such as the presence of pathologies that affect the proper communication capabilities of a speaker. Those speech disorders have different origin depending on the type of the disease. For instance, diseases with morphological origin such as cleft lip and palate that causes hypernasality, or with neurodegenerative origin such as Parkinson's disease that generates hypokinetic dysarthria on the patients. Automatic assessment of pathological speech allows to support the diagnosis and/or the evaluation of the disease severity. Conventional methods are based on the manually applied assessment of single features such as jitter, shimmer, or formant frequencies that may not completely model all of the phenomena that appear due to the disease. This paper introduces a novel strategy based on unsupervised representation learning for automatic detection of pathological speech. The proposed approach is based on the use of recurrent and convolutional autoencoders trained to extract informative features to characterize the presence of pathologies in speech. A novel feature set based on the reconstruction error of the autoencoders is also proposed. The performance of the introduced models is evaluated classifying pathological speech signals recorded from people suffering from Parkinson's disease, and children with cleft lip and palate. All participants from this study were Spanish native speakers. The proposed models are accurate to classify the speech signals of both kinds of diseases, with an accuracy of up to 97% for cleft lip and palate, and up to 84% for the case of Parkinson's disease. We also show that the reconstruction error from the autoencoders in different frequency regions contain information related to specific speech symptoms of both diseases.",

  "abstract": "Early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using the PD patients' voice changes would avoid the intervention before the identification of physical symptoms. Various machine learning algorithms were developed to detect PD detection. Nevertheless, these ML methods are lack in generalization and reduced classification performance due to subject overlap. To overcome these issues, this proposed work apply graph long short term memory (GLSTM) model to classify the dynamic features of the PD patient speech signal. The proposed classification model has been further improved by implementing the recurrent neural network (RNN) in batch normalization layer of GLSTM and optimized with adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) on network hidden layer. To consider the importance of feature engineering, this proposed system use Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) for extracting the dynamic speech features. Based on the computation of energy content transited from unvoiced to voice (onset) and voice to voiceless (offset), dynamic features are measured. The PD datasets is evaluated under 10 fold cross validation without sample overlap. The proposed smart PD detection method called RNN-GLSTM-ADAM is numerically experimented with persistent phonations in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and Matthew correlation coefficient. The evaluated result of RNN-GLSTM-ADAM extremely improves the PD detection accuracy than static feature based conventional ML and DL approaches. ",

  "abstract": "As the number of dimensions of an optimization problem increases, the process of deriving the solution becomes more complicated and difficult. Metaheuristic algorithms are effective methods for solving many optimization problems, whereas most of these algorithms perform poorly on high-dimensional problems. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic algorithm called Dynamic Stochastic Search (DSS) is proposed for high-dimensional optimization problems. To effectively execute the exploration (diversification) and exploitation (intensification) processes of DSS, a dynamic stochastic search process is designed by defining a stochastic search control factor, a search process based on the Gaussian distribution, two shrink modes inspired by the Whale Optimization Algorithm, and a balance mechanism derived from the Bat Algorithm. The proposed algorithm has the following advantages: no specific control parameters other than the population size and the maximum number of iterations, a simple structure, and less computational effort in the implementation. Analyzing the computational complexity of DSS demonstrates its simplicity. To evaluate the performance of DSS, twenty 300-dimensional and 3000-dimensional classical benchmark functions as well as thirty 100-dimensional CEC2014 benchmark functions are utilized. The statistical results prove the effectiveness and feasibility of DSS for high-dimensional optimization problems because it shows better convergence performance and higher efficiency than various advanced optimization algorithms. Moreover, the superiority of DSS in solving high-dimensional real-world optimization problems is validated by applying it to feature selection for ten real-world benchmark classification datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.",

  "abstract": " In recent years, technology in medicine has shown a significant advance due to artificial intelligence becoming a framework to make accurate medical diagnoses. Models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) can detect implicit patterns in data, allowing identifying patients conditions that cannot be seen easily. MLPs consist of biased neurons arranged in layers, connected by weighted connections. Their effectiveness depends on finding the optimal weights and biases that reduce the classification error, which is usually done by using the Back Propagation algorithm (BP). But BP has several disadvantages that could provoke the MLP not to learn. Metaheuristics are alternatives to BP that reach high-quality solutions without using many computational resources. In this work, the Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA) with a specially designed crossover operator called Damped Crossover (DX), is proposed to optimise weights and biases of the MLP to classify medical data. When compared against state-of-the-art algorithms, the CGA configured with DX obtained the minimal Mean Square Error value in three out of the five considered medical datasets and was the quickest algorithm with four datasets, showing a better balance between time consumed and optimisation performance. Additionally, it is competitive in enhancing classification quality, reaching the best accuracy with two datasets and the second-best accuracy with two of the remaining.",

  "abstract": "In recent years, acoustic signals have found increasing popularity among the scientific community as biomarkers for detecting Parkinson's disease. Literature highlights that 90% of people with Parkinson's disease have vocal impairment symptoms at earlier stages of the disease. Standard Parkinson's disease diagnosis depends on medical imaging or observation of motor symptoms such as gait disturbance and muscle rigidity which may appear at later stages. Several acoustic feature extraction algorithms, such as long-term and short-term features, were developed to train machine learning models to detect Parkinson's disease using a single algorithm. Although the literature demonstrates promising results, there has not been any exploitation of the potential of combining solely long-term and short-term algorithms to the best of the authors' knowledge. This paper presents a novel method to investigate the effect of a dataset incorporating long-term and short-term features known as Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) on the performance of random forest model for Parkinson's disease detection. The performance of random forest has been compared between three feature sets: MFCC features, long-term features, and a combination of MFCC with long-term features. The combined features improved the detection accuracy to 88.84%, while independent sets of MFCC and long-term features, were 84.12% and 84.00%, respectively. The findings of the proposed method indicates the effectiveness of the long-term features and MFCC combination in improving the overall performance of Parkinson's disease detection model.",

It is a worldwide public health problem of huge measurement. It is a familiar statistic that around one million people suffer from PD in the United States of America and as a whole around 5 million people suffering from PD worldwide. Therefore, it is vital challenge to predict PD in early stages so that initial plan for the needed treatment can be made. However, imbalanced nature of data sets hampered the mining of medical resource data. In this paper, we proposed an approach for detecting and tracking PD intensity using enhanced SMOTE and XGBoost in Fog Computing on UCI’s Parkinson’s Telemonitoring Voice Data Set of individuals. Numerous investigations were executed and the results of the proposed framework achieve 96.43% accuracy on test set and 99.49% accuracy on full set in detecting PD.",

  "abstract": "Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was designed to analyze nonlinear and non-stationary signals. EMD voice analysis had been applied to Parkinson's sustained vowels, but very limited studies have been done on highly dynamic Diadochokinesia (DDK) utterances. This paper applies the EMD's dyadic filterbank characteristics to extract DDK features and an in-depth study on the efficacy of two segmentation strategies. The EMD analysis on DDK looks at the spectrum characteristics of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and the handling of mode mixing conditions. DDK recordings of Healthy Control (HC) subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were segmented using various fixed frame sizes compared to dynamic segmentation based on/pa-ta-ka/ triad length, and also the signal envelope as a whole. An overlapping windowing of 2/3 was used in the fixed frame size segmentation to augment and to capture the redundant and transition information. No overlapping was used in the/pa-ta-ka/ triad segmentation. For the fixed frame size segmentation, we found that there is a region of consistency. Within this region, the IMF center frequencies and bandwidths maintained the same but varied outside the region. The segmentation comparisons used a basic set of EMD features with and without DeltaEMD features that capture segment-to-segment deviations. Using the basic EMD dyadic features, fixed frame size segmentation out-performed/pa-ta-ka/ triad segmentation. When DeltaEMD features were added to provide segment deviation information,/pa-ta-ka/ triad out-performed fixed frame segmentation. Additional segment-magnitude amplification factor and segment length were found to improve the performance of the/pa-ta-ka/ triad segmentation. With the added features,/pa-ta-ka/ triad out-performed the others and had an improved accuracy of 78%. Additional features have also increased the envelope discrimination to 76%. The results also indicated the potentials of using voice envelopes for PD analysis.",

  "abstract": "To address the problem of high feature dimensionality of Parkinson's disease medical data, this paper introduces SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value for feature selection of Parkinson's disease medical dataset. This paper combines SHAP value with four classifiers, namely deep forest (gcForest), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and random forest (RF), respectively. Then this paper applies them to Parkinson's disease diagnosis. First, the classifier is used to calculate the magnitude of contribution of SHAP value to the features, then the features with significant contribution in the classification task are selected, and then the data after feature selection is used as input to classify the Parkinson's disease dataset for diagnosis using the classifier. The experimental results show that compared to Fscore, analysis of variance (Anova-F) and mutual information (MI) feature selection methods, the four models based on SHAP-value feature selection achieved good classification results. The SHAP-gcForest model combined with gcForest achieves classification accuracy of 91.78% and F1-score of 0.945 when 150 features are selected. The SHAP-LightGBM model combined with LightGBM achieves classification accuracy and F1-score of 91.62% and 0.945 when 50 features are selected, respectively. The classification effectiveness is second only to the SHAP-gcForest model, but the SHAP-LightGBM model is more computationally efficient than the SHAP-gcForest model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with the results of existing literature. The findings demonstrate that machine learning with SHAP value feature selection method has good classification performance in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and provides a reference for physicians in the diagnosis and prevention of Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "A high-level abstract idea of speech is created in previously autonomous systems using unsupervised models. Given that these representations are typically acquired by input reconstruction, it cannot be said with assurance that they are resistant to cues unrelated to disease. Pathology diagnosis cannot usually be reliably performed using unsupervised representations. As a result, in this research, we use pathological voice recognition using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Even though DCNNs have many acknowledged benefits, selecting the best structure for them can be challenging. This work examines the use of the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to automatically choose the best architecture for DCNNs in an effort to address this constraint. In order to achieve the goal, three canonical WOA-based innovations are suggested. First, a special encoding technique based on Internet Protocol Addresses (IPA) is created to make it easier to encode the DCNN layers with whale vectors. The development of variable-length DCNNs is then suggested using an enfeebled layer that has particular whale vector dimensions. The final step in the learning process involves splitting huge datasets into smaller ones and then randomly reviewing them. Pathological audio signals captured from patients are used to assess the performance of the proposed model. In this regard, five measures were used to conduct thorough research, including ROC and precision-recall curves, F1-Score, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. Up to 95.77 percent of the two disordered speech signals are correctly classified by the suggested model, which outperforms the second-best algorithm, VLNSGA-II, by 1.02 percent in terms of accuracy.",

With the huge advancements of technology, the medical data has increased dramatically, and therefore, there is a need to apply data mining and machine learning methods to extract new knowledge from this data. Several classification methods were used to analyze medical data sets and diagnostic problems, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In addition, to improve the performance of classification, feature selection methods have been extensively used in many fields. This paper aims to propose a comprehensive approach to enhance the prediction of PD using several machine learning methods with different feature selection methods such as filter-based and wrapper-based. The dataset includes 240 recodes with 46 acoustic features extracted from 3 voice recording replications for 80 patients. The experimental results showed improvements when wrapper-based features selection method was used with K-NN classifier with accuracy of 88.33%. The best obtained results were compared with other studies and it was found that this study provides comparable and superior results.",

  "abstract": " The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is important in neurological pathology for appropriate medical therapy. Algorithms based on decision tree induction (DTI) have been widely used for diagnosing PD through biomedical voice disorders. However, DTI for PD diagnosis is based on a greedy search algorithm which causes overfitting and inferior solutions. This paper improved the performance of DTI using evolutionary-based genetic algorithms. The goal was to combine evolutionary techniques, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP), with a decision tree algorithm (J48) to improve the classification performance. The developed model was applied to a real biomedical dataset for the diagnosis of PD. The results showed that the accuracy of the J48, was improved from 80.51% to 89.23% and to 90.76% using the GA and GP, respectively.",

  "abstract": "Disease identification and classification relies on Feature Selection (FS) to find the relevant features for accurate medical diagnosis. FS is an optimization problem solved with the help of stochastic optimization strategies. Research on selection of relevant features in Parkinson's disease is challenging due to the lack of enough information about the disease. In this work, a wrapper-based Binary Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (BIGWO) approach is developed for categorizing the Parkinson’s disease with optimal set of features. The proposed approach employs five different transfer functions to encode the search space of features. A mutation operation in BIGWO fine tunes the search process to determine the best features for disease diagnosis. Further, the number of neighbours in k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) is optimized using the Adaptive kNN (AkNN) in the fitness evaluation of the BIGWO algorithm which improves classification performance. Different variants of the proposed BIGWO algorithm are compared with other algorithms to assess their performance. Experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets that demonstrate the two variant BIGWO-V1 and BIGWO-V2 algorithms outperform other four meta-heuristic (GA, PSO, BBA, and MCS) algorithms.",

  "abstract": "In a supervised setting, the global classification paradigm leverages the whole training data to produce a single class discriminative model. Alternatively, the local classification approach builds multiple base classifiers, each of them using a small subset of the training data. In this paper, we take a path to stand in-between the global and local approaches. We introduce a two-level clustering-based method in which base classifiers operate on a larger portion of the input space than in the traditional local paradigm. In particular, we first obtain a grained input representation by employing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to the inputs. We then apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to the SOM units to define input regions — a subset of input samples associated with a specific cluster of SOM units. We refer to this approach as regional classification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of regional classification on several benchmarks. Also, we study the impact of (1) adopting linear and nonlinear base classifiers (e.g., least squares support vector machines) and (2) using cluster validation indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters. Based on the experiments, the regional classification approach achieves competitive performance compared to its global and local counterparts, especially when equipped with linear base classifiers.",

Those cognitive symptoms have various causes depending on the disease. For example, morphological diseases like cleft lip and palate create hypernasality, while neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease cause hypokinetic dysarthria. Automatic assessment of abnormal speech supports early diagnosis or disease severity evaluation. Conventional methods rely on manually assessing single aspects like shimmer, jitter, or formant frequencies, which may not fully reflect the disease's manifestations. In this paper, we use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to recognize disordered speech. Despite DCNNs' many approved benefits, selecting the best structure is challenging. In order to overcome this issue, this research looks into using the chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) to automatically select the optimal DCNN structure. In order to achieve the goal, three ChOA-based advancements are proposed. First, an internet protocol address-based (IPA-based) encoding method for DCNN layers employing chimp vectors is created. Then an Enfeebled layer with specified chimp vector dimensions is presented for variable-length DCNNs. Eventually, large datasets are partitioned into smaller ones and evaluated at random to recognize abnormal speech signals from patients with Parkinson's disease and cleft lip and palate. In addition to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves, five well-known metrics were used: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1-Score. The proposed model accurately diagnoses disordered and normal speech signals, with an accuracy of up to 96.37%, which is 1.62 more accurate than the second-best approach, i.e., VLNSGA-II.",

  "abstract": "The incipient diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) helps to control the disease as early as possible and dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of PD. Therefore, the construction of effective voice features is of great significance. To distinguish PD patients from healthy controls, combined with the idea of formal structure analysis, a voice feature description method of co-occurrence direction attribute topology (CDAT) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the formal context is established according to the direction information statistically obtained in the sub-region of the spectrogram to describe the correspondence between energy points and their direction attributes. Then the CDAT is constructed to obtain the coupling information between the direction attributes in the formal context. Finally, the number of connected domains in the CDAT indicating the degree of nodal coupling is extracted as structural features and input to multiple classifiers for validation. Test and cross-corpora experiments are conducted on two different Parkinsonian sustained vowel datasets, CPPDD and SPDD, achieving the best average classification accuracies of 95.84% and 93.90% with random forest, respectively. The proposed features highlight the variation of energy direction derivatives in the spectrograms through the attribute topology. The results indicate that the proposed method has good classification accuracy on different native language datasets and cross-corpora experiments, which outperforms or is comparable to the performance of latest methods used for PD classification.",

  "abstract": "Voice disorder is an early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), and extracting effective voice features is of great significance for PD detection. The voice features based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) have promising performance in PD detection only using conventional energy and entropy features. To further develop the potential of TQWT, a novel feature extraction method named instantaneous energy variation based on TQWT (IEV-TQWT) is proposed. Firstly, TQWT is adopted to perform multi-scale decomposition to obtain the oscillation information of the voice signals. Next, IEV-TQWT features are obtained by calculating instantaneous energy variation vectors from the spectrograms of sub-signals. Finally, the IEV-TQWT features are input to multiple classifiers to verify the PD classification performance. The results have shown that IEV-TQWT features with explicit physical information have a significant improvement in classification performance. In addition, IEV-TQWT features outperform other advanced features on the CPPDD dataset and reach mainstream level on SPDD dataset, indicating that IEV-TQWT features can be used as an effective assisted diagnosis tool of PD.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a matter of great concern when it comes to the health management of elderly people. Tremors, muscle stiffness, change in cognitive abilities, and dysarthria are some of the frequently encountered symptoms, commonly found in patients diagnosed with PD. A substantive progression of PD can be seen in the patient's body, caused by the degeneration of the dopamine-generating cells. PD is still a non-curable disease but its progression can be slowed down with some medications and therapies. Thus, early detection of the disease becomes a necessity for much-needed care of the patients. Recent developments in the technology sector have rewarded us with an opportunity for early detection of PD using speech signals. In this paper, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approach using spectrograms of speech signals generated by Superlet Transform (SLT) is proposed for the detection of PD. The SLT converts the 1-D speech signals into 2-D spectrogram. These spectrograms of the speech signal are then applied to different DNN classifiers namely InceptionResNetV2, VGG-16, and ResNet50v2 for PD detection. The proposed method is evaluated on sustainable vowels, modulated vowels, DDK analysis, and isolated words of PC-GITA dataset and vowels of ItalianPVS dataset. Several evaluation measures have been used to estimate the robustness and explainability of this work. The developed framework gives the best performance on modulated vowels using VGG-16 on PC-GITA dataset. The VGG-16 with SLT achieved an overall accuracy of 92% with sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-1 score of 92%, 91%, 95%, and 93%, respectively.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex condition that affects an individual's motor features and intensifies over time. Symptoms vary between individuals and can go undetected at an early stage. Voice data has shown potential in predicting PD. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has made significant progress, with ensemble ML approaches proving to be effective in various applications. This research aims to detect PD at an early stage using ensemble techniques on the Parkinson's speech dataset (PSV), which contains several sound recordings with 27 input features and one target feature. Feature importance was computed using Mean Decrease in Impurity (F-MDI), Feature Permutation (F-PER), and Pearson's Correlation (F-CORR) techniques. Several supervised ML baseline models were compared with the proposed Nearest Neighbor Boosting (NNB) technique, which combines k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Gradient Boosting (GB). The NNB technique outperformed the baseline models for multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, F-score, the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and confusion matrix (CM). The findings suggest that the designed ensemble method can be a promising method for PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Voice disorders are one of the incipient symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The existing PD voice feature analysis methods generally reduce dimensionality by selecting features with high relevance and low redundancy, ignoring the complementarity between features. To fully explore the intrinsic connection between PD features, this paper proposes a local dynamic feature selection fusion method (LDFSF) for PD identification and symptom severity prediction. First, the maximal information coefficient is used to calculate the relevance between features and the target value, and removes low relevant features. Then, a dynamic feature selection strategy based on self-organizing map network clustering is designed. This strategy dynamically updates the feature subset in a forward manner, and combines the relevance, redundancy and complementarity for feature selection. Among them, self-organizing map network clustering reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of candidate features, and effectively improves the accuracy of the model. Finally, the selected features are fed into the appropriate classifier or regressor to achieve accurate PD identification and severity progress prediction. Experiments on public OPDD and PTDS datasets show that the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of LDFSF method on OPDD are 98.20%, 92.00% and 99.50% respectively, and the mean absolute error of predicting PD severity (motor- and total-UPDRS) on PTDS are 1.62 and 1.99 respectively, which are better than the compared methods for the selection of five and eight features respectively, thus indicating that the proposed LDFSF method can be effectively used in PD voice diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) corresponds to one of the most common neurological diseases in the world, which is mainly manifested by motor, cognitive, and language disorders. The change in the patient's voice is one of the most striking clinical signs and proves to be an element of interest to support the diagnosis and the assessment of PD. In this research paper, a new approach based on speech signal analysis is set forward to automatically detect Parkinson's disease. The approach evaluates two learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to classify data obtained from speech tasks. Two input data,i.e., the raw speech signal's values and the i-vector features of dimensions 100, 200 and 300 are extracted in this study. Eventually, an evaluation step is undertaken through the use of five evaluation metrics which are accuracy, precision, recall/sensitivity, specificity and -score. The most pertinent obtained results for a test dataset composed of 28 participants are recorded as follows: an accuracy of 100%, precision of 0.99, recall/sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.96 and -score of 0.98. These findings corroborate that our approach can help in terms of PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting 60% of people over the age of 50 years. Patients with Parkinson's (PWP) face mobility challenges and speech difficulties, making physical visits for treatment and monitoring a hurdle. PD can be treated through early detection, thus enabling patients to lead a normal life. The rise of an aging population over the world emphasizes the need to detect PD early, remotely and accurately. This paper highlights the use of machine learning techniques in telemedicine to detect PD in its early stages. Research has been carried out on the MDVP audio data of 30 PWP and healthy people during training of 4 ML models. Comparison of results of classification by Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models, yield Random Forest classifier as the ideal Machine Learning (ML) technique for detection of PD. Random Forest classifier model has a detection accuracy of 91.83% and sensitivity of 0.95. Through the findings of this paper, we aim to promote the use of ML in telemedicine, thereby providing a new lease of life to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson which occurs because of affected motor system by central nervous system is a neurodegenerative disease which is often seen in community. This disease, which is frequently seen especially in the elderly, brings problems such as speech disorders in patients. It is seen that with the rapidly developing deep learning and machine learning methods in recent years, it is possible to distinguish speech disorders in PD patients at a high rate and quickly. In this study, PD diagnosis was performed using datasets containing voice signals of healthy individuals and PD patients (PD_Dataset and PDO_Dataset). Current convolutional neural networks (CNN) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for PD diagnosis have been examined and a comparative performance analysis has been made. In addition, a different method called SkipConNet + RF based on CNN and random forest (RF) has been proposed for PD diagnosis. With the proposed SkipConNet, important features were obtained from the speech signals; then, the estimation process was performed using the RF algorithm. The proposed method provided an improvement between 3% and 17.19% in the performance of RF algorithms. In addition, the SkipConNet + RF method showed the highest success with 99.11% accuracy in the PD_Dataset dataset and 98.30% in the PDO_Dataset dataset.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a matter of great concern when it comes to the health management of elderly people. Tremors, muscle stiffness, change in cognitive abilities, and dysarthria are some of the frequently encountered symptoms, commonly found in patients diagnosed with PD. A substantive progression of PD can be seen in the patient's body, caused by the degeneration of the dopamine-generating cells. PD is still a non-curable disease but its progression can be slowed down with some medications and therapies. Thus, early detection of the disease becomes a necessity for much-needed care of the patients. Recent developments in the technology sector have rewarded us with an opportunity for early detection of PD using speech signals. In this paper, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approach using spectrograms of speech signals generated by Superlet Transform (SLT) is proposed for the detection of PD. The SLT converts the 1-D speech signals into 2-D spectrogram. These spectrograms of the speech signal are then applied to different DNN classifiers namely InceptionResNetV2, VGG-16, and ResNet50v2 for PD detection. The proposed method is evaluated on sustainable vowels, modulated vowels, DDK analysis, and isolated words of PC-GITA dataset and vowels of ItalianPVS dataset. Several evaluation measures have been used to estimate the robustness and explainability of this work. The developed framework gives the best performance on modulated vowels using VGG-16 on PC-GITA dataset. The VGG-16 with SLT achieved an overall accuracy of 92% with sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-1 score of 92%, 91%, 95%, and 93%, respectively. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 96% on the ItalianPVS dataset. This method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods like Hilbert spectrum analysis, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for PD detection using different speech data sources.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurologic disorders for older people that, because of similar symptoms to other neurologic diseases, is difficult to diagnose, mainly in the early stages. Recently, neurologists are trying non-medical methods based on speech processing for early diagnosis of PD. Since some speech characteristics are different between women and men, we analyze them separately in this research and propose a hybrid method to classify the PD and healthy samples. The proposed method's main structure relies on the features' scores, which are based on a projection on a two-dimensional plane. In the first step, several features inherently different between women and men (healthy and PD) are removed from the features. Then, statistical-Based Feature Score (SBFS) and Classification-Based Feature Score (CBFS) are introduced in the proposed method and used as the dimensions of a two-dimensional hyperplane to rank the features. To increase the stability of the model in speech feature selection, resampling of the dataset is considered in the methodology. Different classifiers (linear and nonlinear support vector machine (LSVM and NSVM respectively), K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), naïve Bayesian (NB), and random forest (RF)) are applied for sample classification. Finally, two sets of features are separately introduced for both groups of men and women. We have achieved 86% and 84% accuracy rates for men and women groups with 14 and 12 features, respectively. The results show that the number of selected features is less than the previous work that introduced and used this dataset. The results also present that although the chosen features are different for men and women, most of the selected features are in similar categories. Unlike the previous similar study where the validation method was based on Leave-one-out, in this study, the results are validated based on an independent set of the used dataset to analyze the stability of the selected features.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson which occurs because of affected motor system by central nervous system is a neurodegenerative disease which is often seen in community. This disease, which is frequently seen especially in the elderly, brings problems such as speech disorders in patients. It is seen that with the rapidly developing deep learning and machine learning methods in recent years, it is possible to distinguish speech disorders in PD patients at a high rate and quickly. In this study, PD diagnosis was performed using datasets containing voice signals of healthy individuals and PD patients (PD_Dataset and PDO_Dataset). Current convolutional neural networks (CNN) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for PD diagnosis have been examined and a comparative performance analysis has been made. In addition, a different method called SkipConNet + RF based on CNN and random forest (RF) has been proposed for PD diagnosis. With the proposed SkipConNet, important features were obtained from the speech signals; then, the estimation process was performed using the RF algorithm. The proposed method provided an improvement between 3% and 17.19% in the performance of RF algorithms. In addition, the SkipConNet + RF method showed the highest success with 99.11% accuracy in the PD_Dataset dataset and 98.30% in the PDO_Dataset dataset.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease consists in the degeneration of the mesencephalic black substance, affecting the dopaminergic vias. Its causes are varied, including exposure to pesticides, genetic factors and, one of the most influential ones, age. Given the decrease in dopamine levels, the most common symptoms are the appearance of tremors and muscle rigidity. Due to the rigidity of the muscles, the patient has voice alterations which have great potential for non-invasive and early diagnosis of the disease. In addition, considering the low cost of the sound recorder respect to the clinical studies, this approach allows the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in a large number of people. Recent works, which present the analysis of voice recordings through Convolutional Neural Networks, show high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Convolutional Neural Networks use a Multilayer Neural Network to classify convolutional feature vectors. In order to improve the training time of the classifier, in this paper the use Extreme Learning Machines are proposed. Experiments considering 4 types of spectrograms with AlexNet, VGG-16, SqueezeNet, Inception V3 and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Networks models. In the experiments, hit rate, training and testing time, sensitivity and the specificity indicators of all the neural architectures involved in the work are objectively compared. It is shown that the Extreme Learning Machine have a high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but with reduced training time.",

  "abstract": "Voice disorder is an early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), and extracting effective voice features is of great significance for PD detection. The voice features based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) have promising performance in PD detection only using conventional energy and entropy features. To further develop the potential of TQWT, a novel feature extraction method named instantaneous energy variation based on TQWT (IEV-TQWT) is proposed. Firstly, TQWT is adopted to perform multi-scale decomposition to obtain the oscillation information of the voice signals. Next, IEV-TQWT features are obtained by calculating instantaneous energy variation vectors from the spectrograms of sub-signals. Finally, the IEV-TQWT features are input to multiple classifiers to verify the PD classification performance. The results have shown that IEV-TQWT features with explicit physical information have a significant improvement in classification performance. In addition, IEV-TQWT features outperform other advanced features on the CPPDD dataset and reach mainstream level on SPDD dataset, indicating that IEV-TQWT features can be used as an effective assisted diagnosis tool of PD.",

  "abstract": "Purpose: Neuro-fuzzy systems aim to combine the benefits of artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems: a neural network can learn patterns from data and achieves high performance, whereas a fuzzy system matches inputs and outputs using linguistic and interpretable rules. The combination of these two techniques yields models that can both perform well and provide interpretability in a fuzzy linguistic manner. Design: In this paper, the performance and interpretability of five neuro-fuzzy classifiers were evaluated (three Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) classifiers: adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy system (DENFIS), self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN), and two Mamdani classifiers: hybrid fuzzy inference system (HyFIS) and neuro-fuzzy classifier (NEFCLASS)). All the empirical evaluations were over four benchmark medical datasets (Wisconsin breast cancer dataset, SPECTF heart dataset, Parkinsons dataset, and diabetic retinopathy Debrecen dataset), and used five performance criteria (accuracy, precision, recall, f score, and training time) and two interpretability criteria (number of rules and number of membership functions). Findings: Results showed that the TSK-based self-organizing fuzzy neural network classifier, in general, outperformed the others. In terms of interpretability, DENFIS and NEFCLASS were the best Takagi-Sugeno-Kang and Mamdani classifiers respectively. The findings also suggested that three classifiers: DENFIS, SOFNN, and NEFCLASS achieved a good performance-interpretability tradeoff. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, no study has compared the neuro-fuzzy techniques presented in this paper in terms of performance and interpretability in the medical domain.",

  "abstract": "Objective: Voice analysis based systems offer low-cost, highly available automatic diagnostic aid for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection anywhere a smartphone with a broadband connection is available. However, reliability depends on factors affecting the communication channel. In this paper the effects of recording device mismatch are analyzed. Multicondition training (MCT) is proposed to improve robustness against that mismatch. Methods: An experiment on 30 PD patients and 30 healthy subjects was designed. 3 vocalizations of sustained a were recorded using a smartphone. These recordings, along with a simulation of 8 additional smartphones, were analyzed. Acoustical features were extracted and averaged per patient and recording device. Machine learning was used to distinguish healthy from PD patients by using different combinations of train-test smartphones. Results: By using the same device for training and testing, a 10% best-worse mean accuracy drop is observed. The gap among different devices reaches 37%. MCT retains 90% of the maximum accuracy and exceeds a 20% mean accuracy while lowers dispersion of the aggregated results obtained with single condition. Smartphone position shows a direct impact on performance. Conclusion: Recording device has a major effect on results. It is also found that positioning of the recording device might also be influential. Using MCT appears to improve robustness. Significance: Results support the use of mobile devices to create an automated PD detection test. It is also encouraged to consider the use of MCT to obtain more robust and reliable results across different devices.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson's voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16 kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigación en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97 ± 0.03, recall: 0.96 ± 0.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.",

  "abstract": "This research takes a unique approach to improve the accuracy of Parkinson's disease prediction through speech signal analysis by turning to the natural world for inspiration. This research proposes an optimization algorithm modelled on the hunting strategies of eagles. This approach begins with the extraction of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from the audio signals. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm, inspired by the keen eyesight and hunting strategy of eagles, is employed to select the most relevant MFCC features. This optimization ensures a reduced dimensionality while maintaining the integrity and relevance of the feature set. Eagle's highly effective three-pronged approach to hunting - consisting of soaring (exploring), scanning (assessing), and swooping (taking action) - is the starting point for this method. To put this into practice, the proposed algorithm treats each potential combination of audio signal features as a 'solution', or 'prey'. The usefulness or 'fitness' of each solution is evaluated according to how accurately it can predict Parkinson's disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a validation dataset. At the start, our algorithm generates an array of solutions. It then takes an 'eagle's eye view', assessing and refining these solutions in successive iterations. This mimics the eagle's hunt, where it identifies its target from a distance, before swooping in to capture it. By testing the proposed eagle-inspired algorithm on the Parkinson's Disease Voice Initiative (PDVI) dataset, it was found that it offers better accuracy in differentiating between those with Parkinson's and those without, compared to traditional methods. Specifically, using the proposed algorithm's selected features, the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 93.2% compared to an 88.5% accuracy when using all MFCC features. Furthermore, the computation time was reduced by 15% due to the dimensionality reduction introduced by the proposed algorithm. In conclusion, this study opens up a promising new direction in the early detection and treatment of Parkinson's disease, demonstrating the value of looking to nature for solving complex problems.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor symptoms. Its symptoms develop slowly, making early identification difficult. Machine learning has a significant potential to predict Parkinson's disease on features hidden in voice data. This work aimed to identify the most relevant features from a high-dimensional dataset, which helps accurately classify Parkinson's Disease with less computation time. Three individual datasets with various medical features based on voice have been analyzed in this work. An Ensemble Feature Selection Algorithm (EFSA) technique based on filter, wrapper, and embedding algorithms that pick highly relevant features for identifying Parkinson's Disease is proposed, and the same has been validated on three different datasets based on voice. These techniques can shorten training time to improve model accuracy and minimize overfitting. We utilized different ML models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bagging Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, and Gradient Boosting. Each of these models was fine-tuned to ensure optimal performance within our specific context. Moreover, in addition to these established classifiers, we proposed an ensemble classifier is found on a high optimal majority of the votes. Dataset-I achieves classification accuracy with 97.6 %, F1-score 97.9 %, precision with 98 % and recall with 98 %. Dataset-II achieves classification accuracy 90.2 %, F1-score 90.2 %, precision 90.2 %, and recall 90.5 %. Dataset-III achieves 83.3 % accuracy, F1-score 83.3 %, precision 83.5 % and recall 83.3 %. These results have been taken using 13 out of 23, 45 out of 754, and 17 out of 46 features from respective datasets. The proposed EFSA model has performed with higher accuracy and is more efficient than other models for each dataset.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative condition characterised by a combination of motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment and anxiety. Although there is currently no known cure, there are available treatments that can effectively mitigate symptoms and enhance life expectancy. Our research primarily centred around vocal disorders, given that an estimated 90% of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease experience the onset of such disorders in the early stages of the disease. In this study, a dataset is collected from UCI repository consisting of 252 cases was utilised, with 188 cases classified as Parkinson's disease and 64 cases classified as non-Parkinson's disease. The results of our study indicate that the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm demonstrated a peak accuracy of 98.52% and an average accuracy of 97.33%, surpassing the performance of previously established models. Additionally, we introduced the implementation of Parzen Windows Estimation (a KDE technique) and computed classifier accuracies based on mean test set scores after multiple rounds of data reshuffling and model training. Our results enhance credibility compared to previous works in this field. Given the high misdiagnosis rate (26%) and the expense of imaging tests, deploying a precise and cost-effective algorithm for early PD detection is critical.",

  "abstract": "Classification methods relying on multidimensional features have been widely applied in commerce, healthcare, and transportation. Nevertheless, haphazardly selecting inappropriate features may not only hinder the improvement of classification performance but also disrupt the convergence of classifier parameters, leading to prolonged classifier runtime and an increased storage burden. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel framework (dubbed as DFS-WR) to perform dual selection and weighted representation of multidimensional features. Firstly, DFS-WR employs Laplacian scores to conduct a de-redundant operation as the first feature selection. Subsequently, DFS-WR utilizes a correlation coefficient matrix and redundant sorting to eliminate duplicate deployment of similar features in classification through the second selection. Finally, for hierarchical expression, DFS-WR assigns weights by virtue of information gain (IG), thereby emphasizing the significance of dominant features. The performance of DFS-WR was further evaluated across four aspects: classification ability, runtime performance, storage occupancy, and portability and universality, using five public datasets and eleven widely adopted classifiers. Additionally, this paper considered the proper configuration of crucial parameters within DFS-WR and compared it with other related works. The results indicated that the dual selection strategy for eliminating redundancy and similarities among features could improve the performance of classifiers, and the weighted process based on IG outperformed unweighted and ReliefF-based weighted methods. By employing DFS-WR to multidimensional features, the classifier's runtime and data storage capacity were effectively reduced. In addition, it was proved that the deployment of DFS-WR generally had no limitations on datasets and classifiers, underscoring its good portability and universality in practical applications.",

  "abstract": "Background: Biomedical voice measurements have been used by many physicians and scientists to distinguish Parkinson's patients from ordinary people. Measurements of biomedical voices involve many variables calculated from signal analysis of the voice. These variables can be used to distinguish Parkinson's patients from non-Parkinson's patients. Unfortunately, using all computed variables may be ineffective and inaccurate due to the complexity of establishing a relationship between all the input variables and Parkinson's states. Methods: This paper describes the development of a hybrid optimizer by combining two optimization algorithms: the Grey Wolf Optimizer and the Whale Optimizer. The hybrid optimizer enhances feature selection to provide a fast and robust Parkinson's prediction model. Additionally, this research incorporates five other feature selection algorithms for comparison purposes: Ranker, Greedy, BestFirst, Hybrid Grey Wolf Optimization, and Whale Optimization. The outputs from these algorithms are fed into six prediction models to determine the most accurate combination. These models include the neural network, Quest, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection, support vector machine, CR-tree, and logistic regression models. Subsequently, the developed models are compared to identify the most accurate model based on various performance metrics. Results: The combination of the hybrid grey wolf and whale models yielded the highest scores in most metrics, achieving a perfect recall and a high F1 score. All models generated similar output, with an accuracy greater than 0.89. Quest, CR-tree, and neural networks are the most reliable and accurate models. Conclusions: Biomedical sound measurements can be used to develop an accurate and cost-effective Parkinson's prediction model.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor symptoms. Its symptoms develop slowly, making early identification difficult. Machine learning has a significant potential to predict Parkinson's disease on features hidden in voice data. This work aimed to identify the most relevant features from a high-dimensional dataset, which helps accurately classify Parkinson's Disease with less computation time. Three individual datasets with various medical features based on voice have been analyzed in this work. An Ensemble Feature Selection Algorithm (EFSA) technique based on filter, wrapper, and embedding algorithms that pick highly relevant features for identifying Parkinson's Disease is proposed, and the same has been validated on three different datasets based on voice. These techniques can shorten training time to improve model accuracy and minimize overfitting. We utilized different ML models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bagging Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, and Gradient Boosting. Each of these models was fine-tuned to ensure optimal performance within our specific context. Moreover, in addition to these established classifiers, we proposed an ensemble classifier is found on a high optimal majority of the votes. Dataset-I achieves classification accuracy with 97.6 %, F1-score 97.9 %, precision with 98 % and recall with 98 %. Dataset-II achieves classification accuracy 90.2 %, F1-score 90.2 %, precision 90.2 %, and recall 90.5 %. Dataset-III achieves 83.3 % accuracy, F1-score 83.3 %, precision 83.5 % and recall 83.3 %. These results have been taken using 13 out of 23, 45 out of 754, and 17 out of 46 features from respective datasets. The proposed EFSA model has performed with higher accuracy and is more efficient than other models for each dataset.",

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by the progressive loss of dopamine. Approximately 90% of PD patients experience voice impairments and this has been used as a precursor to develop diagnostic decision support systems for the early detection of the disease. Since speech data is heavily dependent on the language and the locality of the individual, an important requirement of such a diagnostic decision support system is the ability to classify PD irrespective of the linguistic demography of the speakers and generalize well to heterogeneous populations and external patient data. Methods: This study focuses on the development of a data-driven language independent PD classification model based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). Sustained phonations in Spanish and Italian are decomposed into VMD modes and used along with a deep learning framework to establish cross-lingual validity. The performance of the proposed method is also assessed within the same dataset alongside assessing generalizability to a different dataset of the same language. Additionally, the possibility of gender bias and the robustness of the proposed method on realistic data is also evaluated. Results: The best results show that the proposed method has a cross-lingual accuracy between 65% and 80%. The cross-linguistic validity scores are higher than all values reported by studies using vowels, including models that have used transfer learning on the target language. The proposed method shows 90% to 95% accuracy when tested within the same dataset and has up to 63% generalizability on an independent dataset with realistic recording settings. It is seen that a consistent performance independent of the gender of the speaker is achieved using the proposed method of training the deep learning classifier with VMD modes. Conclusions: The proposed method of using VMD modes and a deep learning classifier has displayed consistent performance across all the tests, including multilingual and same linguistic demography in the data; and across varied recording conditions. The study highlights the importance of testing the generalizability and the effect of bias in the reported results from the oversight of training data choice and limited testing. The results from the study suggest that the proposed method can be used to develop a robust, language independent generalizable model to aid in the detection of PD from voice.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological condition that progresses over time. People start to have trouble speaking, writing, walking, or performing other basic skills as dopamine-generating neurons in some brain regions are injured or die. The patient's symptoms become more severe due to the worsening of their signs over time. In this study, we applied state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to diagnose Parkinson's disease and identify related risk factors. The research worked on the publicly available dataset on PD, and the dataset consists of a set of significant characteristics of PD. We aim to apply soft computing techniques and provide an effective solution for medical professionals to diagnose PD accurately. This research methodology involves developing a model using a machine learning algorithm. In the model selection, eight different machine learning techniques were adopted: Namely, Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Logistic Regression (LR). Subsequently, the concentrated models were validated through 10-fold Cross-Validation and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)—Area Under the Curve (AUC). In addition, GridSearchCV was utilised to measure each algorithm's best parameter; eventually, the models were trained through the hyperparameter tuning approach. With 98% accuracy, LightGBM had the highest accuracy in this study. RF, KNN, and SVM came in second with 96% accuracy. Furthermore, the performance scores of NB and LR were recorded to be 76% and 83%, respectively. It is to be mentioned that after applying 10-fold cross-validation, the average performance score of LightGBM accounted for 93%. At the same time, the percentage of ROC-AUC appeared at 0.92, which indicates that this LightGBM model reached a satisfactory level. Finally, we extracted meaningful insights and figured out potential gaps on top of PD. By extracting meaningful insights and identifying potential gaps, our study contributes to the significance and impact of PD research. The application of advanced machine learning algorithms holds promise in accurately diagnosing PD and shedding light on crucial aspects of the disease. This research has the potential to enhance the understanding and management of PD, ultimately improving the lives of individuals affected by this condition.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to build a pre-diagnosis tool for predicting Parkinson's disease based on a speech disorder which appears as a symptom in approximately 90% of people with this disease. Recently, some technologies such as AIoT and IoMT aim to integrate Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things or Internet of Medical Things to provide an intelligent remote diagnosis for enhancing medical services. Thus, the classification speed and reliability of the systems in these fields are highly recommended. In this work, we compared five ML algorithms (LR, RF, XGB, SVM, KNN) based on their performance, classification speed and reliability. We employed the sequential forward feature selection in order to select the optimal relevant feature for reducing the dimensionality of the used acoustic dataset to enhance both the performance and computation cost for the proposed system. Furthermore, the stratified cross-validation approach has been used to obtain a fair estimation for the proposed system across each point in the dataset. In this paper, we used a vocal dataset of Parkinson's disease consisting of 195 samples and 22 features. We found that 10 features provide the optimal performance. So, we proposed the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm as a classifier for our system. It reached 98.46%, 99.33% and 98.67% of the accuracy, sensitivity and precision respectively. Moreover, this work provides a detailed explanation of the employed techniques and the obtained results. The novelty of this work, compared to the existing literature, is to enhance both computation cost and performance for building a real-world system to diagnose Parkinson's disease through speech disorder.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, a debilitating neurological disorder affecting mobility, stands as one of the most prevalent and life-altering conditions within the realm of neurological disorders. Tragically, it currently lacks a definitive cure, significantly impacting life expectancy and resulting in substantial disabilities. Recognizing and diagnosing the condition early is paramount to mitigating its effects. Notably, more than 90% of individuals afflicted by Parkinson's experience speech impairments. This underscores the significance of speech features in the diagnostic process. To streamline and improve the accuracy of Parkinson's diagnosis, this study employs an automated diagnostic process. It leverages ensemble methods, integrating feature selection techniques, and implements the Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT) classifier based on voice characteristics. Through rigorous experimentation, the effectiveness of the ERT classifier is assessed using various feature selection methods. Notably, when combined with embedded LASSO, the ERT classifier achieves an impressive accuracy of 87%. This substantial improvement in diagnostic accuracy has far-reaching implications for early detection and management of Parkinson's disease. By providing clinicians and healthcare professionals with a reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective screening tool, this approach promises to significantly enhance the quality of life for patients battling this debilitating condition.",

  "abstract": "The immense amount of data managed during the diagnosis process overwhelms, by far, the clinicians' processing capabilities. Artificial intelligence methods like Multi-Layer Perceptrons come to help by providing a second opinion based on powerful and reliable data processing. Unfortunately, these methods often suffer from problems related to their training methods, which can lead to poor performance. Metaheuristics are promising training alternatives because of their stochastic and general-purpose nature. This work introduces a new training method based on metaheuristics, called Genetic Ant Lion Optimiser. It includes new features for dealing with the convergence problems of the original Ant Lion Optimiser and integrates a novel crossover operator for avoiding stagnation. Experiments compare our proposal against 31 state-of-the-art algorithms, over 20 different medical datasets. Classification quality metrics reflect that our approach attains a robust and efficient behaviour with the majority of the datasets, obtaining highlighted results, such as an accuracy of 1.0 with the kidney dataset (bi-class) and 0.943 with the lung-cancer dataset (multi-class). Besides, it reaches adequate convergence rates and reasonable time consumption.",

  "abstract": "People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) might struggle with sadness, restlessness, or difficulty speaking, chewing, or swallowing. A diagnosis can be challenging because there is no specific PD test. It is diagnosed by doctors using a neurological exam and a medical history. This study proposes several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict PD. These ML algorithms include K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms (XGBoost), and their ensemble methods using publicly available PD dataset with 195 instances. The ML algorithms are used to predict and classify PD using homogeneous XGBoost ensemble techniques with reduced amount of entropy. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized to handle imbalanced data, and 10-fold cross-validation is employed for evaluation. The results show that the homogeneous XGBoost-Random Forest outperforms other ML methods with 98% accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient value 0.93.",

  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by the progressive loss of dopamine. Approximately 90% of PD patients experience voice impairments and this has been used as a precursor to develop diagnostic decision support systems for the early detection of the disease. Since speech data is heavily dependent on the language and the locality of the individual, an important requirement of such a diagnostic decision support system is the ability to classify PD irrespective of the linguistic demography of the speakers and generalize well to heterogeneous populations and external patient data. Methods: This study focuses on the development of a data-driven language independent PD classification model based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). Sustained phonations in Spanish and Italian are decomposed into VMD modes and used along with a deep learning framework to establish cross-lingual validity. The performance of the proposed method is also assessed within the same dataset alongside assessing generalizability to a different dataset of the same language. Additionally, the possibility of gender bias and the robustness of the proposed method on realistic data is also evaluated. Results: The best results show that the proposed method has a cross-lingual accuracy between 65% and 80%. The cross-linguistic validity scores are higher than all values reported by studies using vowels, including models that have used transfer learning on the target language. The proposed method shows 90% to 95% accuracy when tested within the same dataset and has up to 63% generalizability on an independent dataset with realistic recording settings. It is seen that a consistent performance independent of the gender of the speaker is achieved using the proposed method of training the deep learning classifier with VMD modes. Conclusions: The proposed method of using VMD modes and a deep learning classifier has displayed consistent performance across all the tests, including multilingual and same linguistic demography in the data; and across varied recording conditions. The study highlights the importance of testing the generalizability and the effect of bias in the reported results from the oversight of training data choice and limited testing. The results from the study suggest that the proposed method can be used to develop a robust, language independent generalizable model to aid in the detection of PD from voice.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor symptoms. Its symptoms develop slowly, making early identification difficult. Machine learning has a significant potential to predict Parkinson's disease on features hidden in voice data. This work aimed to identify the most relevant features from a high-dimensional dataset, which helps accurately classify Parkinson's Disease with less computation time. Three individual datasets with various medical features based on voice have been analyzed in this work. An Ensemble Feature Selection Algorithm (EFSA) technique based on filter, wrapper, and embedding algorithms that pick highly relevant features for identifying Parkinson's Disease is proposed, and the same has been validated on three different datasets based on voice. These techniques can shorten training time to improve model accuracy and minimize overfitting. We utilized different ML models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bagging Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, and Gradient Boosting. Each of these models was fine-tuned to ensure optimal performance within our specific context. Moreover, in addition to these established classifiers, we proposed an ensemble classifier is found on a high optimal majority of the votes. Dataset-I achieves classification accuracy with 97.6 %, F1-score 97.9 %, precision with 98 % and recall with 98 %. Dataset-II achieves classification accuracy 90.2 %, F1-score 90.2 %, precision 90.2 %, and recall 90.5 %. Dataset-III achieves 83.3 % accuracy, F1-score 83.3 %, precision 83.5 % and recall 83.3 %. These results have been taken using 13 out of 23, 45 out of 754, and 17 out of 46 features from respective datasets. The proposed EFSA model has performed with higher accuracy and is more efficient than other models for each dataset.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson's voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16 kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigación en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97 ± 0.03, recall: 0.96 ± 0.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.",

  "abstract": "The design and development of an automated Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis framework still remains one of the most complex and crucial tasks in the present day. In the traditional works, various feature extraction + optimization + classification models are developed for accurately detecting the PD from the speech signals. Yet, it has the problems of computational expenses, increased time for processing the signals, complexity to understanding the system model, and error results. Therefore, the proposed work motivates to development of a unique and advanced Adaptive Intelligent Polar Bear (AIPB) Optimization-Quantized Contempo Neural Network (QCNN) model for PD diagnosis. Here, the Determinate Haar Wavelet (DHW) transformation technique is used for preprocessing the speech signals by removing the noise and improving the quality. Consequently, the Statistical Time Frequency Renyi (STFR) feature extraction model is used to extract the useful features related to the Parkinson's disease. Then, the AIPB optimization algorithm is deployed to extract the most relevant features required for detecting PD. Then, the QCNN technique is used to accurately predict the speech signal as to whether healthy or PD is affected. To validate this framework, various PD speech signal datasets are used for analysis. Also, the obtained results are compared with the recent PD detection approaches by using various evaluation indicators.",

  "abstract": "Background and objective: Medical data plays a decisive role in disease diagnosis. The classification accuracy of high-dimensional datasets is often diminished by several redundant and irrelevant features. In this context, feature selection becomes an indispensable process. Feature selection primarily intends to identify a feature subspace which retains the classification accuracy while reducing the high computational cost of learning model as well as eliminating noise. The suitability of an appropriate feature selection approach heavily depends upon the capability of that approach to match the problem framework and to discover the intrinsic patterns within the data. The prime objective of this paper is to develop an ensemble-filter based hybrid feature selection model for disease detection. Methods: In this paper, a four-step hybrid ensemble feature selection algorithm has been introduced. Firstly, the dataset is partitioned using the cross-validation procedure. Secondly, in the filter step, various filter methods based on weighted scores were ensembled to generate a ranking of features, and thirdly sequential forward selection algorithm is utilized as a wrapper technique to obtain an optimal subset of features. Finally, the resulting optimal subset is processed for subsequent classification tasks. Results: Experiments have been performed on twenty benchmark medical datasets with different dimensionalities. The performance of the proposed hybrid approach is compared with fourteen state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms on four benchmark classifiers namely, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbor. The empirical results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid methodology over the competing methods with respect to accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, area under curve evaluation measures and number of selected features. The statistical analysis of the obtained results shows the outperformance and the competitiveness of the proposed hybrid method with respect to various state-of-the-art algorithms. Conclusions: This study concludes that the proposed hybrid approach proves to be more effective and reliable feature selection technique in selecting highly discriminative features. The framework can be utilized as a promising tool by both clinicians and researchers in enhancing the classification performance of medical datasets.",

  "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very important Kansara et al. (2013) and Stern (1993). In recent years, machine learning-based speech data analysis has been shown to be effective for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) and automatically assessing rehabilitative speech treatment in PD Sakar et al. (2013), Tsanas et al. (2012) and Little et al. (2009). Machine learning includes feature learning and sample learning. Deep learning (deep feature learning) can generate high-level and high-quality features through deep feature transformation, improving classification accuracy. For reasons such as data collection, some samples have low quality for classification. Therefore, sample learning is necessary. Sample selection removes useless samples; therefore, deep sample learning is better, since it can generate high-level and high-quality samples through deep sample transformation. However, there are no public studies about deep sample learning. To solve the problem above, a deep dual-side learning ensemble model is designed in this paper. In this model, a deep sample learning algorithm is designed and combined with a deep network (deep feature learning), thereby realizing the deep dual-side learning of PD speech data. First, an embedded stack group sparse autoencoder is designed in this paper to conduct deep feature learning to acquire new high-level deep feature data. Second, the deep features are fused with original speech features by L1 regularization feature selection methods, thereby constructing hybrid feature data. Third, an iterative mean clustering algorithm (IMC) was designed, thereby constructing a deep sample learning algorithm and conducting deep sample transformation. After that step, hierarchical sample spaces are constructed based on a deep sample learning algorithm, and the classification models are constructed on the sample spaces. Finally, the weighted fusion mechanism is designed to merge the classification models into a classification ensemble model, thereby fusing the deep feature learning algorithm and the deep sample learning algorithm together. The ensemble model is called the deep dual-side learning ensemble model. At the end of this paper, two representative speech datasets of PD were used for validation. The experimental results show that the main innovation part of the algorithm is effective. For the two datasets, the mean accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 98.4% and 99.6%, which are better than the state-of-art relevant algorithms. The study shows that deep dual-side learning is better for existing deep feature learning for PD speech recognition.",

  "abstract": "Feature selection has shown its effectiveness in improving the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, especially for those tasks with high-dimensional data. In this article, a novel self-learning feature selection (SLFS) approach based on feature attributions is proposed as a wrapper method, which has higher search efficiency for optimal feature subsets with three main improvements. First, we regard feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose a unified local search framework for wrapper methods by analyzing meta-heuristic algorithms in feature selection. Second, for the binary search space of feature selection, we propose two types of neighborhood structures, namely, ring-type and line-type structures, for the local search framework. Third, we focus on feature attribution methods, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) (Lundberg & Lee, 2017), which can interpret each feature’s importance to predictions. In each iteration, we adopt SHAP values and other attributes from previous subsets to guide the next selection of new subsets. To validate the performance of our SLFS approach, we collected 16 classification datasets from the UCI repository for comparison with other meta-heuristic wrapper approaches in terms of fitness, accuracy, F1 scores and selection ratios. The experimental results show that the SLFS approach can be used to obtain an optimal subset with fewer iterations and a small population, and SHAP values play a role in improving search efficiency.",

  "abstract": "Voice disorders are one of the incipient symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that approximately 90% of PD patients suffer from vocal disorders. Therefore, it is significant to extract pathological information on the voice signals to detect PD. In this paper, a feature, named energy direction features based on empirical mode decomposition (EDF-EMD), is proposed to show the different characteristics of voice signals between PD patients and healthy subjects. Firstly, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were obtained through the decomposition of voice signals by EMD. Then, the EDF is obtained by calculating the directional derivatives of the energy spectrum of each IMFs. Finally, the performance of the proposed feature is verified on two different datasets: dataset-Sakar and dataset-CPPDD. The proposed approach shows the best average resulting accuracy of 96.54% on dataset-Sakar and 92.59% on dataset-CPPDD. The results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper is promising in the field of PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disease due to loss of brain cells, which produces dopamine. It is most common after Alzheimer's disease specially seen in old age people. In the earlier stage of disease, it has been noticed that most of the people suffering from speech disorder. From last two decades many studies have been conducted for the analysis of vocal tremors in PD. This study explores the combined approach of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Hilbert spectrum analysis (HSA) to investigate the voice tremor of patients with PD. A new set of features Hilbert cepstral coefficients (HCCs) are proposed in this study. Proposed features are assessed using vowels and words of PC-GITA database. The effectiveness of HCC features is utilized to perform classification, and regression analysis for PD detection. The highest average classification accuracy up to 91% and 96% is obtained with vowel /a/ and word /apto/ respectively. Further the classification accuracy up to 82% is obtained with independent dataset, when tested with the optimized model developed using PC-GITA database. In dysarthria level prediction highest correlation up to 0.82 is obtained using vowel /a/ and 0.8 with word /petaka/. The outcomes of this study indicate that the proposed articulatory features are suitable and accurate for PD assessment.",

  "abstract": "The classification of Parkinson's disease speech data is useful and popular. However, the existing public Parkinson's disease(PD) speech datasets are characterized by small sample sizes, and the possible reason is that labeled speech data from PD patients are scarce. To solve the few-shot problem, a PD classification algorithm based on sparse kernel transfer learning combined with simultaneous sample and feature selection is proposed in this paper. Sparse kernel transfer learning is used to extract the effective structural information of PD speech features from public datasets as source domain data, and the fast alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) iteration is improved to enhance the information extraction performance. First, features are extracted from a public speech dataset to construct a feature dataset as the source domain. Then, the PD target domain, including the training and test datasets, is encoded by convolution sparse coding, which can extract more in-depth information. Next, simultaneous optimization is implemented. To further improve the classification performance, a convolution kernel optimization mechanism is designed. In the experimental section, two representative PD speech datasets are used for verification; the first dataset is a frequently used public dataset, and the second dataset is constructed by the authors. Over ten relevant algorithms are compared with the proposed method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvements in terms of classification accuracy. The study also found that the improvements are considerable when compared with nontransfer learning approaches, demonstrating that the proposed transfer learning approach is more effective and has an acceptable time cost.",

  "abstract": "n this paper, support vector machines (SVMs), least squares SVMs (LSSVMs), relevance vector machines (RVMs), and probabilistic classification vector machines (PCVMs), are compared on sixteen binary and multiclass medical datasets. Particular emphasis is put on the comparison among the commonly used Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) kernel, and the relatively new generalized min-max (GMM) kernel and exponentiated-GMM (eGMM) kernel. Since most medical decisions involve uncertainty, a postprocessing approach based on Platt's method and pairwise coupling is employed to produce probabilistic outputs for prediction uncertainty assessment. The extensive empirical study illustrates that the SVM classifier using the tuning-free GMM kernel (SVM-GMM) shows good usability and broad applicability, and exhibits competitive performance against some state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that SVM-GMM can be used as the first-choice method when selecting an appropriate kernel-based vector machine for medical diagnosis. As an illustration, SVM-GMM efficiently achieves a high accuracy of 98.92% on the thyroid disease dataset consisting of 7200 samples.",

We propose the creation of a model based on supervised learning, to learn the patterns associated with the voice of PD patients. We used 1400 voice recordings of PD patients and controls which were preprocessed, further were obtained 70 features for each recording, and then we used a supervised learning algorithms such as a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the data between patients and controls. From all machine learning models evaluated the SVM model showed the best performance, with an accuracy of 88%.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain. As PD progresses, there arises a problem of maintaining coordination between brain and different parts of the body. Subjects have the problem of performing daily activities. Its early diagnosis is important to improve the quality of life of Parkinson's patients. Most of Parkinson's patients are likely to have voice disorders in the early stages. Therefore, the analysis of voice recordings with machine learning-based models can improve the diagnosis process. Voice signals are non-linear, non-stationary signals which exhibit oscillatory behavior. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed to extract features from resonance-based and time-frequency based information. A combination of Resonance based Sparse Signal Decomposition (RSSD) + Time-Frequency (T-F) algorithm is proposed. Two datasets are collected for the study. The first dataset D1 is a public dataset consisting of 16 PD + 21 Healthy Controls (HC) and the second dataset D2 is collected from 20 HC to explore the effect of diversity in the diagnosis process. To explore the potential of deep learning techniques in diagnosing speech impairments in PD patients, the potential of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is also explored. To evaluate the method, we conducted several experiments with state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification techniques. The proposed hybrid approach distinguished PD and HC with a validation accuracy of 99.37%. We have also explored the effect of diversity in the data collection process and it is observed that diversity in the socio-cultural group plays very important role to put the system in the clinical practice.",

  "abstract": "In this work, a voice-based analysis is conducted with the contribution of providing physicians with a decision tool along with framing information to help them see functional differences and understand why the detection method suspects PD. The voice-based detection method consists in applying feature subset selection and four different classifiers to voice recordings from five datasets (gender-based, balanced and unbalanced) derived from the largest public dataset for voice-based PD detection. One of the contributions is an improvement over previous works on voice-based PD detection over the same dataset, in terms of performance and complexity. The detection performance is characterized by 95.9% of accuracy, 98.35% of sensitivity, 91.06% of specificity, and 95.6% of precision in women; and 94.36% of accuracy, 100% of sensitivity, 97.1% of specificity, and 96.83% of precision in men. The number of features, fed to classifiers, ranges from 6 to 20. This work shows that different factors are associated with PD detection according to gender: high-frequency voice content is the most significant functional information to assist PD detection in women, while low-frequency content assists PD detection in men better. It is shown that a comparison of the variability of the most important features between patients with PD and controls can be used as contextual information by a physician to have a better interpretation of the classification.",

  "abstract": "Apart from the need for superior accuracy, healthcare applications of intelligent systems also demand the deployment of interpretable machine learning models which allow clinicians to interrogate and validate extracted medical knowledge. Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as 'weight low' or 'glucose level high' while describing symptoms. This paper proposes an approach by performing data-driven learning of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule bases for clinical decision support. The approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, capable of capturing simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the framework of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), thereby further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents. Experimental studies on popular medical data benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed work is able to learn compact rule bases involving simple rule antecedents, with statistically better or comparable performance to those achieved by state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.",

  "abstract": "The speech signal is like the black box of human beings where much information is hidden. The treatment of this signal provides us with the speaker's identity. In a way, it is similar to an identity card. Moreover, some neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer, depression, and Parkinson are detected based on the features extraction from the speech signals. In our study, we have recourse to the evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm GA, which is most commonly used in the making of a decision. The genetic algorithm intervenes with the Support vector machine SVM algorithm. This algorithm is a supervised machine learning that can be employed to design models defining important data classes, where class characteristics are involved in the construction of the classifier. In this article, a model of classification is proposed by the use of a discrete wavelet transform DWT to transform the signal. A Linear predictive coding LPC, energy, zero-crossing rate ZCR, Mel frequency cepstral coefficient MFCC, and wavelet Shannon entropy features are extracted from the approximation a3. Then by applying the GA and the classifier SVM, the best accuracy obtained was 91.18%.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a methodology that can help in the detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD) from voice recordings. It is based on eight of voice features, describing vocal folds behavior such as frequency and amplitude perturbations, biomechanical instability and neurological tremor, where, each of the proposed features will be represented by one vector representing their statistical distribution by using their probability density functions. The features are extracted from 42 samples of sustained vowel emissions of /a/, from both healthy and PD voices subjects to fulfill this purpose. A new preprocessing technique is then conducted. The approach uses pertinent matrices built for each subject. The matrices are composed of vectors arranged by segment, feature and number of phonation cycles. An estimation of the maxima maximorum (MM) and minima minimorum (mm) values is used to normalize the data. Then, each of the normalized vectors is submitted to an outlier removal process. The performance of the effective predicted attributes has been tested using rank feature selection. Then, the decision phase is realized by applying three types of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers: a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (K-NN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Even though the three types of used ML classifiers give high rate decisions, the experimental results showed that the RF classifier can improve the efficiency of the preprocessing approach achieving a recognition rate of 99 % for females and 98 % for males, in detecting PD dysphonia. The results presented here outperform those published in the literature.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive-neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 6 million people around the world. However, conventional techniques for PD detection are often hand-crafted, in which special expertise is needed. In this study, considering the importance of rapid diagnosis of the disease, it was aimed to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automated PD identification based on biomarkers-derived voice signals. The developed CNN methods consisted of two main stages, including data pre-processing and fine-tunning-based transfer learning steps. To train and evaluate the performance of the developed model, datasets were collected from the mPower Voice database. SqueezeNet1_1, ResNet101, and DenseNet161 architectures were retrained and evaluated to determine which architecture can classify frequency-time information most accurately. The performance results revealed that the proposed model could successfully identify the PD with an accuracy of 89.75%, sensitivity of 91.50%, and precision of 88.40% for DenseNet-161 architecture identified as the most suitable fine-tuning architecture. The results revealed that the proposed model based on transfer learning with a fine-tuning approach provides an acceptable detection of PD with an accuracy of 89.75%. The outcomes of the study confirmed that by integrating the developed model into smart electronic devices, it will be able to develop alternative pre-diagnosis methods and will assist the physicians for PD detection during the in-clinic assessment. The success of the proposed model would imply an enhancement in the life quality of patients and a cost reduction for the national health system.",

The majority of people suffering from PD develop several voice impairments mainly related to what is known as dysarthric speech. Voice analysis can help in PD detection and in the evaluation of the dysarthria level of the patients. This study introduces time-frequency features to model discontinuities and abrupt changes that arise in the voice signal due to PD. The proposed method consists of four stages: time-frequency matrix (TFM) representation, TFM decomposition using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), feature extraction and classification. Statistical analyses show that the proposed time-frequency features significantly differentiate between PD patients and healthy speakers. Experiments with sustained vowel phonations and isolated words of the corpus PC-GITA are conducted. The proposed method achieved average classification accuracies of up to 92% in vowels, and 97% in words. There is an improvement in accuracy ranging from 10% to 40% compared to existing methods. Further, the developed models are evaluated upon an independent dataset. Results on this separate test set show accuracies ranging from 63% to 75% in vowels, and from 53% to 75% in isolated words. Regarding the dysarthria level evaluation, Spearman's correlations between original and predicted labels are around 0.81 in sustained vowels and in isolated words. The results indicate that the proposed approach is suitable and robust for the automatic detection of PD.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can cause many non-motor and motor symptoms such as speech and smell. One of the difficulties that Parkinson's patients can experience is a change in speech or speaking difficulties. Therefore, the right diagnosis in the early period is important in reducing the possible effects of speech disorders caused by the disease. Speech signal of Parkinson patients shows major differences compared to normal people. In this study, a new approach based on pre-trained deep networks and Long short-term memory (LSTM) by using mel-spectrograms obtained from denoised speech signals with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for detecting PD from speech sounds is proposed. The proposed model consists of four steps. In the first step, the noise is removed by applying VMD to the signals. In the second step, mel-spectrograms are extracted from the enhanced sound signals with VMD. In the third step, pre-trained deep networks are preferred to extract deep features from the mel-spectrograms. For this purpose, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models are used as pre-trained deep network architecture. In the last step, the classification process is occurred by giving these features as input to the LSTM model, which is designed to define sequential information from the extracted features. Experiments are performed with the PC-GITA dataset, which consists of two classes and is widely used in the literature. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the latest methods in the literature, it is seen that it has a better performance in terms of classification performance.",

  "abstract": "Voice disorders are one of the incipient symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that approximately 90% of PD patients suffer from vocal disorders. Therefore, it is significant to extract pathological information on the voice signals to detect PD. In this paper, a feature, named energy direction features based on empirical mode decomposition (EDF-EMD), is proposed to show the different characteristics of voice signals between PD patients and healthy subjects. Firstly, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were obtained through the decomposition of voice signals by EMD. Then, the EDF is obtained by calculating the directional derivatives of the energy spectrum of each IMFs. Finally, the performance of the proposed feature is verified on two different datasets: dataset-Sakar and dataset-CPPDD. The proposed approach shows the best average resulting accuracy of 96.54% on dataset-Sakar and 92.59% on dataset-CPPDD. The results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper is promising in the field of PD detection.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for diagnosing Parkinson's disease using ensemble classification of patient voice samples. Conducted research concerned testing the parameters of the ensemble of classifiers, in terms of types and numbers of classifiers included in it. More than a dozen popular classifiers were considered in the study. Additionally, for each of the tested classifiers, a set of features of voice samples were selected, for which a given classifier showed the highest classification efficiency. The Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), which belongs to the wrapper methods, was used for feature selection. The ensemble of classifiers was then tested in two cases, with all features considered and including only those indicated by the SBS method. The obtained results were compared with each other.All experiments were performed on a publicly available database containing voice samples of Parkinson's patients and healthy patients. This database can be found in the UCI archives.",

  "abstract": "Standard classifiers struggle with high-dimensional datasets due to increased computational complexity, difficulty in visualization and interpretation, and challenges in handling redundant or irrelevant features. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method based on the Mahalanobis distance for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification. The proposed feature selection identifies relevant features by measuring their distance from the dataset's mean vector, considering the covariance structure. Features with larger Mahalanobis distances are deemed more relevant as they exhibit greater discriminative power relative to the dataset's distribution, aiding in effective feature subset selection. Significant improvements in classification performance were observed across all models. On the 'Parkinson Disease Classification Dataset', the feature set was reduced from 22 to 11 features, resulting in accuracy improvements ranging from 10.17 % to 20.34 %, with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 98.31 %. Similarly, on the 'Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features', the feature set was reduced from 45 to 18 features, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 1.38 % to 13.88 %, with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieving the best accuracy of 95.83 %. By identifying convergence features and eliminating divergence features, the proposed method effectively reduces dimensionality while maintaining or improving classifier performance. Additionally, the proposed feature selection method significantly reduces execution time, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in medical diagnostics, where timely and accurate disease identification is critical for improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The voice features extracted from voice signals can be effectively used for PD detection. Among them, the energy features extracted based on attribute topology have achieved preliminary results by combining time-frequency domain and structure representation. However, these energy features are susceptible to temporal fluctuation and are sensitive to weak coupling, which reduces their stability and representativeness. To solve these problems, this paper proposes the connected structural feature based on adaptive frequency attribute topology (CS-AFAT). Firstly, the energy statistic windows are established according to the distribution of spectral lines in the spectrogram for the aggregated statistics of energy information in time domain, which can effectively eliminate the influence of time disturbances. Secondly, the attribute topology is established to preform visualized statistics on the energy variation information of each point in the window. Finally, to reduce the influence of weak coupling in the topology, the adaptive threshold mechanism is designed to remove the edge with low coupling strength in the topology, so as to obtain more stable and representative features for PD classification. The results on two different language datasets show that the highest classification accuracy of CS-AFAT is 92.41% and 96.67%. The advantage of the proposed CS-AFAT is that it can obtain classification performance superior to or comparable to advanced energy features while having low-dimensional feature representation, which verifies the effectiveness and advancement of the CS-AFAT feature extracted by combining global energy information statistics and adaptive threshold mechanism.",

Research has revealed that verbal impediments manifest in the early of PD, making them a potential diagnostic marker. This study introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize a fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) model, enhancing the detection of PD. BO-FKNN was validated on a speech datasets. To comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, BO-FKNN was compared against five commonly used parameter optimization methods, including FKNN based on Particle Swarm Optimization, FKNN based on Genetic algorithm, FKNN based on Bat algorithm, FKNN based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, and FKNN based on Grid search. Moreover, to further boost the diagnostic accuracy, a hybrid feature selection method based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Information Gain (IG) was employed prior to the BO-FKNN method, consequently the PCCIG-BO-FKNN was proposed. The experimental outcomes highlight the superior performance of the proposed system, boasting an impressive classification accuracy of 98.47%.",

  "abstract": "With the rise in Parkinson's disease (PD) cases in an aging society, daily screening is essential to reduce the burden on neurologists. Based on the above scenarios, this paper proposes a feature attention fusion network (FAFNet) for the measurement of early PD digital biomarkers by smartphone. Concretely, the smartphone voice recording is converted into two spectrograms, emphasizing low and high frequencies. Two spectrograms are then processed through a feature extraction network comprising CNN skeleton, self-attention module, and channel-spatial attention module. The self-attention module can improve the expressiveness of the model, while the channel-spatial attention module highlights the most informative channels and spatial positions. To effectively fuse the features, we design an attention fusion module that can automatically learn and assign weights. Additionally, we propose a Custom Loss function that accounts for measurement accuracy and the impact of the attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that FAFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

Speech analysis has shown promising results in detecting PD, and this study employs machine learning to identify the disease. The goal is to diagnose PD by analysing voice signals, which are non-invasive and have potential for detecting the disease. Various classification algorithms like XGBoost, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), KNN, and Random Forest are tested on a voice dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository), and evaluation metrics are used to get the best classifier. XGBoost outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 95% using RFE feature selection technique. However, the small dataset size of 195 instances limits the model's generalization ability. With a larger dataset, the model could perform even better.

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs as a result of a decrease in the chemical called dopamine in the brain. There is no definitive treatment for PD, but some medications used to control symptoms in the early stages have a critical effect on the progression of the disease. Approximately 90% of patients with PD have vocal problems, and although voice disorders seen in the early stages are not apparent in the patient's speech, they can be detected by acoustic analysis. In this study, a decision support system was proposed for the diagnosis of PD utilizing the feature extraction power of autoencoder (AE) & long short-term memory (LSTM) models by using speech signals as input data. Firstly, simple (SAE), convolutional (CAE), and recurrent (RAE) AE models were created for the ablation analysis. Then, the effect of hybridization and deepening of these models with LSTM layers on the classification performance was observed. Within the scope of the study, RAE achieved the highest accuracy among the base models while CAE & LSTM hybrid model provided the highest performance among all models with 95.79% accuracy for PD diagnosis based on audio signals. It was concluded that hybridization of the AE and LSTM models significantly improved the performance of simple and convolutional AE, and deepening the network to a certain extent improves the classification performance according to the type of AE.",

  "abstract": "Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The voice features extracted from voice signals can be effectively used for PD detection. Among them, the energy features extracted based on attribute topology have achieved preliminary results by combining time-frequency domain and structure representation. However, these energy features are susceptible to temporal fluctuation and are sensitive to weak coupling, which reduces their stability and representativeness. To solve these problems, this paper proposes the connected structural feature based on adaptive frequency attribute topology (CS-AFAT). Firstly, the energy statistic windows are established according to the distribution of spectral lines in the spectrogram for the aggregated statistics of energy information in time domain, which can effectively eliminate the influence of time disturbances. Secondly, the attribute topology is established to preform visualized statistics on the energy variation information of each point in the window. Finally, to reduce the influence of weak coupling in the topology, the adaptive threshold mechanism is designed to remove the edge with low coupling strength in the topology, so as to obtain more stable and representative features for PD classification. The results on two different language datasets show that the highest classification accuracy of CS-AFAT is 92.41% and 96.67%. The advantage of the proposed CS-AFAT is that it can obtain classification performance superior to or comparable to advanced energy features while having low-dimensional feature representation, which verifies the effectiveness and advancement of the CS-AFAT feature extracted by combining global energy information statistics and adaptive threshold mechanism.",

  "abstract": "Standard classifiers struggle with high-dimensional datasets due to increased computational complexity, difficulty in visualization and interpretation, and challenges in handling redundant or irrelevant features. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method based on the Mahalanobis distance for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification. The proposed feature selection identifies relevant features by measuring their distance from the dataset's mean vector, considering the covariance structure. Features with larger Mahalanobis distances are deemed more relevant as they exhibit greater discriminative power relative to the dataset's distribution, aiding in effective feature subset selection. Significant improvements in classification performance were observed across all models. On the 'Parkinson Disease Classification Dataset', the feature set was reduced from 22 to 11 features, resulting in accuracy improvements ranging from 10.17 % to 20.34 %, with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 98.31 %. Similarly, on the 'Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features', the feature set was reduced from 45 to 18 features, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 1.38 % to 13.88 %, with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieving the best accuracy of 95.83 %. By identifying convergence features and eliminating divergence features, the proposed method effectively reduces dimensionality while maintaining or improving classifier performance. Additionally, the proposed feature selection method significantly reduces execution time, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in medical diagnostics, where timely and accurate disease identification is critical for improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Background: Given the limitations of current diagnostic methods, there is a compelling need to develop a more accurate and efficient method for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD). As dysarthria is one of the most characteristic and core symptoms of PD, acoustic analysis of patients' voice recordings may be a new means to diagnose PD. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of employing acoustic analysis to diagnose PD in the Chinese population. Methods: A total of 140 Chinese participants, 96 PD patients and 44 healthy controls respectively, provided their voice recordings on sustained vowels (/a:/, /i:/, /u:/). A deliberate acoustic analysis was performed to identify acoustic parameters with diagnostic values. Machine learning-based diagnostic models were also constructed, which can automatically output a possible diagnosis for reference based on one's voice recordings. Results: Through acoustic analysis, we have identified 14 instances of significant differences across 8 unique acoustic parameters. Light gradient boosting machine model achieved an area under the curve of 0.96 along with the highest accuracy of 92.86%, the sensitivity of 89.47%, and the specificity of 100.00%. Conclusion: Our preliminary results in the Chinese population showed that PD patients presented noticeable phonatory deficits and proved the feasibility of applying acoustic analysis to PD diagnosis, which may have significance in guiding further clinical research.",

  "abstract": "Speech and language technologies are effective tools for identifying the distinct speech changes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Models leveraging recent advancements in self-supervised speech pretraining, such as Wav2Vec, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional feature extraction methods. While Wav2Vec 2.0 has been successfully utilized for PD detection, a rigorous quantitative comparison with Wav2Vec 1.0 is needed to comprehensively evaluate its advantages, limitations, and applicability across different speech modes in PD. This study presents a systematic comparison of Wav2Vec 1.0 and Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings across three multilingual datasets using various classification approaches to classify normal (healthy controls; HC) and PD-affected speech. Additionally, both Wav2Vec 1.0 and 2.0 were benchmarked against traditional baseline features across diverse linguistic contexts, including spontaneous speech, non-spontaneous speech, and isolated vowels. A multicriteria TOPSIS approach was employed to rank feature extraction methods, revealing that Wav2Vec 2.0 excelled across speech modes, with its first transformer layer demonstrating the best performance for classifying read text and monologue, and its feature extractor performing best in vowel-based classification. In contrast, Wav2Vec 1.0, while generally outperformed by Wav2Vec 2.0, still provided a more efficient alternative with competitive performance. Finally, we combined selected layers from both architectures and have demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy in vowel-based classification. This comparative analysis underscores the strengths of both Wav2Vec architectures and informs their optimal use in PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and cognition, impacting millions of people worldwide. The diagnosis of PD primarily relies on clinical tests, which can often result in delayed identification of the disease. Recent advancements in data-driven methods using deep learning have demonstrated potential for improving early diagnosis by utilizing clinical and vocal inputs. This study conducted a comparative analysis of five deep learning models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically for the detection of PD using vocal biomarkers. Among these models, the MLP achieved the highest predictive accuracy at 97.4 %. The RNN, GRU, and Autoencoder models attained a similar accuracy rate of 87.2 %. In contrast, the GAN model yielded an accuracy of only 76.9 %. The UCI vocal dataset from Kaggle was utilized in this research, along with extensive data preprocessing techniques to address missing values. Performance evaluation was conducted using multiple metrics. The results indicate that deep learning models can effectively diagnose PD using voice data, suggesting their potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support clinical decision-making. Furthermore, these models are feasible for large-scale integration into clinical workflows.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) damage to the brain's nerve cells. Detecting the initial symptoms, including tremors, muscular rigidity, decreased balance, and trouble walking, requires a prolonged time. The PD ranks among the leading causes of disability and death among neurological disorders, according to the “World Health Organization”. Insufficient evidence from blood tests and MRI scans to support early diagnosis makes it challenging for doctors to detect PD in its initial stages. An excellent early alert indicator and a predictor of PD is through speech. Predicting the onset of Parkinson's disease using audio recordings of both healthy people and those with the condition is the subject of this research. Effective evaluation of individual and ensemble machine learning approaches for PD classification using quantitative acoustic measure data is carried out in this article. This paper implements several ML methods, including “Support Vector Machine”, “Random Forest”, “Gradient Boosting Classifier”, “K-Nearest Neighbor”, “Logistic Regression”, and “Decision Tree”. An ensemble model is utilized incorporating stacking and stacking with cross-validation methods. The model performance is assessed using four metrics: “Accuracy”, “Recall”, “Precision”, and “F1 score”. The models are analysed and compared, showing accuracy levels ranging from 70% to 82% using the PD dataset. The higher-performing models are selected for a stacking ensemble to enhance overall performance. The stacking ensemble approach achieved an accuracy of 92% and provides accurate recognition of the disease. Subsequently, a stacking cross-validation classifier is employed to all models, resulting in an improved accuracy of 95%.",

  "abstract": "Despite significant advances on automatic detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on speech, several open challenges still need to be addressed before a validated computer-aided diagnosis system can be used practically. One of these challenges lies in considering the potential corruption of speech caused by environmental noises, which may be nonstationary and exhibit varied characteristics. Speech features automatically extracted from diadochokinetic (DDK) tests have shown utility in assessing articulatory aspects of speech impairment in PD. The authors propose an automatic PD detection system based on a multicondition training (MCT) framework. The approach considers various types of realistic acoustic noise in addition to DDK recordings and uses machine learning for feature selection and classification. For each experiment, the noise addition process did not artificially increase the dataset size, as each subject's recordings were either affected by a single noise type or had no injected noise. To compare with this MCT-based approach, an alternative method is examined where training involves speech samples affected by uniform noise conditions. This method, referred to as single-condition training (SCT), involves training with features either from the original waveforms or from waveforms altered by noise addition, ensuring uniformity by using the same type of realistic noise across all the training samples. The benefit of the MCT approach is demonstrated by showing the results obtained in classification tests to discriminate patients affected by PD from healthy individuals. The experiments performed were based on an in-house voice recording database composed of 30 individuals diagnosed with PD and 30 healthy controls. The speech samples were recorded using a smartphone as a data collection device so that the samples were not affected by speech compression algorithms. Both approaches (SCT and MCT) were tested against each specific type of noise under consideration. The mean accuracy rates showed improvements of 1.68%, 5.18%, and 4.39% for/pa/,/ta/, and/ka/ syllables, respectively, when using MCT compared with SCT. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first strategy published in the literature to deal with the potential corruption of speech by environmental noise in automatic PD detection aid systems based on DDK tests.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel classifier based on the Clark distance for early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) using voice data. The nonlinear nature of human voice signals and their inherent fluctuations pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), which struggle to capture meaningful relationships within the voice data for accurate classification. The proposed classifier addresses these limitations by segmenting the data features of each voice sample into smaller blocks (ranging in size from 2 to 10 features per block), to better capture relationships and minimize fluctuations that negatively impact classification accuracy. To further enhance the performance of the classifier, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) was integrated to select high-harmony (convergent) features while removing irrelevant and redundant (divergent) features. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 94.6% without GWO and an impressive 98.305% accuracy with GWO, using only 12 selected features. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates efficient execution time, making it well-suited for real-time applications in medical organizations. The combination of the Clark distance classifier with GWO not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures computational efficiency, enabling its deployment in diverse settings such as hospitals and home monitoring systems for early detection and continuous monitoring of PD patients. This study highlights the potential of the proposed approach as a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable solution for voice-based PD detection.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, and impaired balance due to the degeneration of neurons. This paper proposes an Early Parkinson's disease Diagnosis using Transition Propagation Graph Neutral Network with Dynamic Hunting Leadership Optimization algorithm using voice features/attributes (EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO) approach. First, the pre-processed voice data are analyzed using Synchrosqueezing Fractional Wavelet Transform (SFWT) to extract hand crafted features. Then, Dynamic Hunting Leadership Optimization (DHLO) algorithm is employed to feature selection for identifying the most relevant features. The Zebra Optimization Algorithm is employed to enhance the classification accuracy and optimize the weight parameters of Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TPGNN). The proposed EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO method achieves 24.68% to 26.22% higher accuracy, 26.18% to 29.18% greater specificity, and 24.48% to 28.49% improved precision compared to the existing DPD-CNN-LSTM, PP-PD-ANN and EPDI-TSVS-ML models. Finally, the EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO approach demonstrates a significant improvement over the existing techniques.",

  "abstract": "Speech and language technologies are effective tools for identifying the distinct speech changes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Models leveraging recent advancements in self-supervised speech pretraining, such as Wav2Vec, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional feature extraction methods. While Wav2Vec 2.0 has been successfully utilized for PD detection, a rigorous quantitative comparison with Wav2Vec 1.0 is needed to comprehensively evaluate its advantages, limitations, and applicability across different speech modes in PD. This study presents a systematic comparison of Wav2Vec 1.0 and Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings across three multilingual datasets using various classification approaches to classify normal (healthy controls; HC) and PD-affected speech. Additionally, both Wav2Vec 1.0 and 2.0 were benchmarked against traditional baseline features across diverse linguistic contexts, including spontaneous speech, non-spontaneous speech, and isolated vowels. A multicriteria TOPSIS approach was employed to rank feature extraction methods, revealing that Wav2Vec 2.0 excelled across speech modes, with its first transformer layer demonstrating the best performance for classifying read text and monologue, and its feature extractor performing best in vowel-based classification. In contrast, Wav2Vec 1.0, while generally outperformed by Wav2Vec 2.0, still provided a more efficient alternative with competitive performance. Finally, we combined selected layers from both architectures and have demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy in vowel-based classification. This comparative analysis underscores the strengths of both Wav2Vec architectures and informs their optimal use in PD detection.",
