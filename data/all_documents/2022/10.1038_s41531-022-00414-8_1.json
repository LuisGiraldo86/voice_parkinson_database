  "abstract": "Hypomimia and voice changes are soft signs preceding classical motor disability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to investigate whether an analysis of acoustic and facial expressions with machine-learning algorithms assist early identification of patients with PD. We recruited 371 participants, including a training cohort (112 PD patients during 'on' phase, 111 controls) and a validation cohort (74 PD patients during 'off' phase, 74 controls). All participants underwent a smartphone-based, simultaneous recording of voice and facial expressions, while reading an article. Nine different machine learning classifiers were applied. We observed that integrated facial and voice features could discriminate early-stage PD patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) diagnostic value of 0.85. In the validation cohort, the optimal diagnostic value (0.90) maintained. We concluded that integrated biometric features of voice and facial expressions could assist the identification of early-stage PD patients from aged controls.",
