  "abstract": "A highly accurate automated approach using a deep structured neural network was proposed to detect Parkinson's disease through voice samples. This cost-effective and non-invasive method aims to enhance diagnostic precision and assess the disease's stage of progression. The study addresses two classification problems: binary and multi-category classification. The binary classification deep structured neural network achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 97.6%. For multiclass classification, a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) and a K- nearest neighbor technique for benchmarking, were utilized using a shared database. Nature Inspired Algorithm (NIA)-Genetic Algorithm was employed to optimize the initial feature set. The suggested deep structure neural network demonstrated a 93.7% accuracy in estimating the disease's stage, showing promising results. Further investigations are encouraged to explore the model's adaptability and pursue improved outcomes.",
