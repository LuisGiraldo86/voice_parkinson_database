  "abstract": "An early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is important for patients' quality of life and current detection methods are not optimal in this task. The search of an automatic, low-cost, non-invasive method would be appropiate to delevope a computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning models based on data such as neural networks are at the core of many of these systems. In this work 5 convolutional neural network architectures have been compared by their capability on classifying spectrograms generated with PCGita database. For this classification task, transfer learning using Saarbrücken Voice Database and a data augmentation technique have been addresed with 14 models from the 5 architectures. After performing 5-fold cross-validation, results show that VGG16 architecture is able to distinguish between healthy and PD spectrograms with around 85% of global accuracy. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this technology with multicondition training in medical environments.",
