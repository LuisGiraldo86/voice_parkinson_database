  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is a neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system which results in improper functioning of body movements including difficulty in speaking, walking, rigidity and so on. The aim is to classify the Parkinson's disease based on acoustic voice features in dysphonic speech disorder in Parkinson's patients using state of art machine learning algorithms. For this, some of the parametric and nonparametric machine learning techniques were used on voice features dataset. The aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of state of art algorithms such as Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Algorithm to detect Parkinson's disease which gives higher classification accuracy. Data Preprocessing is done on speech attributes and fed into the machine learning models to evaluate the performance. Various performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score are computed for all four machine learning techniques and the results shows that nonparametric models using Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors produces higher classification accuracy of 87.2% and 90.2% compared to parametric models.",
