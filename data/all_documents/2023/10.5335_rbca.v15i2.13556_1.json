  "abstract": "The Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative illness which impairs motor and speech skills, in addition to provoke behavior, mood and thinking changes. It hits, more usually, the elderly population and its diagnosis is done by a clinical exam, by the observation of a patient's symptoms. Since the most notorious symptoms appear in advanced stages of the disease, which makes the treatment more difficult, and that the world is passing through a process of age pyramid inversion, the tendency is that the Parkinson will become a global public health issue. Within this context, proposals for the use of voice signals as a form of early diagnosis of Parkinson's have been achieving results. This work proposes the construction of a tool to aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease using voice signals associated with Machine Learning techniques. Using a set of data with different attributes extracted from the speech of carriers and non-carriers of the pathology, an accuracy of 93.8 % was obtained using a Random Forest algorithm and performing a cross-validation with the k-fold technique.",
