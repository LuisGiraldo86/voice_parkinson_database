  "abstract": "Voice disorder is an early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), and extracting effective voice features is of great significance for PD detection. The voice features based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) have promising performance in PD detection only using conventional energy and entropy features. To further develop the potential of TQWT, a novel feature extraction method named instantaneous energy variation based on TQWT (IEV-TQWT) is proposed. Firstly, TQWT is adopted to perform multi-scale decomposition to obtain the oscillation information of the voice signals. Next, IEV-TQWT features are obtained by calculating instantaneous energy variation vectors from the spectrograms of sub-signals. Finally, the IEV-TQWT features are input to multiple classifiers to verify the PD classification performance. The results have shown that IEV-TQWT features with explicit physical information have a significant improvement in classification performance. In addition, IEV-TQWT features outperform other advanced features on the CPPDD dataset and reach mainstream level on SPDD dataset, indicating that IEV-TQWT features can be used as an effective assisted diagnosis tool of PD.",
