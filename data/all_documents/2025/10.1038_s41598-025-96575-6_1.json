  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor control, leading to symptoms such as tremors and stiffness. Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment, but traditional methods are often time-consuming and expensive. This study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, using voice analysis to detect early signs of PD. We applied a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a dataset of 81 voice recordings. Acoustic features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), jitter, and shimmer were analyzed. The model achieved 91.11% accuracy, 92.50% recall, 89.84% precision, 91.13% F1 score, and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9125. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provided data explainability, identifying key features driving the PD diagnosis, thus enhancing AI interpretability and trustability. Furthermore, a probability-based scoring system was developed to enable PD patients and clinicians to track disease progression. This AI-driven approach offers a non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid tool for early PD detection, facilitating personalized treatment through vocal biomarkers.",
